		<description>Thanks for the great post.  I like how you identified the root cause, then gave three potential solutions and the situations in which you'd use them.  You saved me quite a chunk of time; keep up the good work!</description>

		<description>Not to talk your leg off but an area I am having to do this a lot with is to accommodate not getting circular references for serializing my objects to json.  I have been making entity objects off of views to do this but in many cases if i can tweak the model to ignore a relational key it seems like a better fix.  

How are you getting rid of circular references for javascriptserializer?</description>

		<description>What happens when you update the model from the database after this.  Do you have to keep removing the xml.  Oh well I am about to find out.</description>

		<description>Nice post.  I am wrestling with this same aspect of entity myself.  Sometimes I wish I had just done the projects with NHibernate but there is a lot about entity I like.  I agree though that when you have to go edit the xml just to tell it to do something that should be standard operating procedure.  The next version better have this fixed.</description>
