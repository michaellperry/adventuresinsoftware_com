		<description>[...] If you didn’t set up AD yourself, you will need to talk to the person who did. Get a connection string, username, and password that gives you read-only access to the server. If you would like to try this yourself before involving your network operator, you can set up a virtual network in Microsoft Virtual PC. [...]</description>

		<description>You will want to make sure your VMs are not configured to 'Pause' when not in use. They must continue to run (be active) in the background for your pings between the VMs to work.</description>

		<description>Are you running multiple VMs? If so, try hitting the WSS virtual machine from the other one. If this doesn't work, then make sure that the loopback adapter is selected for both machines.

Even if you aren't running multiple VMs, you should be able to do what you are trying to. Check the IP address and subnet mask of the loopback adapter. The IP address of the VM should be within the same subnet. So if, for example, the loopback adapter is at 192.168.23.45 and 255.255.255.0, and the VM is at 10.123.1.103, then it won't work. The host machine won't know to route packets down the virtual network, and they won't make it to the VM. Change the loopback adapter to 10.123.1.1.

One final test would be to see if you can get to the Intenet from the VM. If you cannot, make sure that the default gateway of the VM is the IP address of the loopback adapter, and that you have shared your Internet connection on the host with the loopback adapter.

		<description>It seems like you are doing the same thing as i want to do, but i can't get it working.

I have a vista machine and installed vpc2007 and installed win2003 server and additional wss.

And i want my Pc to view pages on my virtual wss.
But it is not working.
My virtual pc itself works fine!!!

Do you have any tips</description>
