		<description>Boy do I look tired... 

Remember the first night in Dallas at the go-kart track, before they assigned teams? You were talking to me for your podcast and you said "I hope you're on my team?" 

Funny that it worked out that way. I have to say I got lucky having you on mine. Although we had some stumbling blocks along the way, your cool-headed attitude and great presentation skills were a huge strength for us.
