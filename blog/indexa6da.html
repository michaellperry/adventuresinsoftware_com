		<description>Hi,
i am developing a system that conects to AD, and i have done it fine by code,
i have textbox txtUserName the get Authenticated User ond page Load,

ond visual studio no problem, it takes the current user, but when a deploy i receive Network Service;

i have    in Web.config,
i Have configured  ? user but , i still get this error,

the code i used to get the user is 
IIdentity identity = System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent(true);

i can identity.name = "domain\\user" on debug machine.

But after deployment 

txtUserName.Text = "Network Service";

Best regards.</description>

		<description>Hi, Tim. I haven't tried this macro on C++ projects, so I can't promise that it works. But I don't think there is anything language specific in the macro. Can you debug and step through it to see where it goes wrong?</description>

		<description>Hello Michael,

Does your macro also work for C++-solutions. I tried yours and Stuart's solution, but no .dot file was generated when running the macro neither in visual studio's macro editor nor when selecting the solution in the solution explorer and running a shortcut for the macro. Any ideas?


Cheers,
Tim</description>

		<description>Why not have them in the following order instead?

Identity
Dependency
Interface
Ownership
Transaction</description>
