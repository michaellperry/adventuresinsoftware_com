		<description>Thanks for the comments, Jim. How are John, Helen, and Daniel, BTW?

You are absolutely correct in that revocation does not scale up to an open community. But it works well for closed project teams, as evidenced by the testimonials on Groove.net.

But even when authority is centralized, it should be in the hands of a community leader, not an IT manager. IT owns the platform, but the community owns the data. I strongly disagree with the role-based notion of opening everything up to "root".</description>

		<description>Another non-Jim-related question: does your decentralized scenario have an implicit assumption of benevolence on the part of all participants? Particularly when we're talking about a geographically diverse group of large cardinality, what is to stop a malicious member from randomly revoking the membership of others? Granted, this is at worst an inconvenience, as those memberships can be reinstated by any other member . . . but if you've ever spent time in online communities with open membership policies, you know that a single jerk can play havoc with the well-behaved members of the community. And you end up, once again, with one or more trusted people in a centralized position of authority (can you say "root?") in order to overcome this nuisance and maintain order.

I'll grant that this may be slightly better, in that the centralized authority is only required in the presence of malicious users: not so likely in small workplace environments, but with a likelihood approaching certainty as the groupsize (and/or anonymity level) grows.</description>

		<description>So . . . what on earth makes you think that JIM would leave the team? Don't you mean John? Or Helen? I get the feeling that those two are much more irresponsible than this Jim fella. You can never trust a John, and certainly not a Helen . . . maybe even a Daniel is suspect--from time to time--but a Jim? 

No way.

A Jim is money in the bank. A Jim is the Rock. The Foundation. Steadfastness personified. Etc, etc.

Otherwise, you seem to have pretty interesting insights for a duck lover.

Sincerely,

earwicker[ch]</description>
