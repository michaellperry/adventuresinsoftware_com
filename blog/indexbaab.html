<p>At Handmark, we use Subversion for source code control. (Check out this <a href="http://www.polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/subversion">Subversion Quickstart</a> at the Polymorphic Podcast.) Like most systems, it supports concepts like branching and tagging. The mechanics for each system varries, so check your documentation for those details. But a more interesting question is, how do you manage branches and tags? Where do you make your changes? What steps do you take when it's time to release?</p>
<p>There are essentially two schools of thought for branching: for features or for releases. We've chosen to branch for features and merge into the trunk to build a release. But another option would be to make all code changes in the trunk and branch at the point of release. You choose your policy based on where you will accept instability. If you can tolerate an unstable trunk, then branch for releases. If you need to isolate instability in the branches, then branch for features.</p>
<p>We've chosen to branch for features because our priorities change quickly. This strategy allows us to isolate changes away from each other, put them on hold for a time if necessary, and keep the trunk stable. All builds are performed from the trunk, so changes must be merged from their branches to the trunk prior to release.</p>
<p>Once we've build a release, it moves through various staging areas. A build starts in integration, moves to testing, and finally into production. At each point along the way, there are checks in place to ensure that it is ready to move forward. The pipeline is rigid in that no build may pass another on the way to production, and no build can move backward. If a build fails one of the checkpoints, it drops out of the pipeline. If we need to expidite a change to production, the build that's currently in the pipeline is dumped.</p>
<p>We find that this policy works best for our environment. It may or may not apply to yours. Choose the policy that fits your team, discuss it, document it, and stick to it.</p>

<p>Russell Elledge and I have been conducting interviews at Handmark, looking for help on our Pocket Express and On Demand applications. In this office, we work on the server side, focusing on making these applications robust enough to handle the large numbers of cell phones that are out in the world. So one question that Russell likes to ask our candidates is as follows:</p>
<p>Name five things that you always do in a scalable enterprise application.</p>
<p>This is an open-ended question designed to create discussion and debate, as well as to test the boundaries of their experience. I thought we could all benefit from Russell's experience, so I asked him to answer the question. This is his list:</p>
<ol>
<li>All information must be a transient in memory.</li>
<li>All information must be in a universally accessible data store or file system.</li>
<li>Use an RPC technology to force the creation of tiers in a system.</li>
<li>Use SOA where possible to help force vertical scalability.</li>
<li>Control your resources.</li>
<li>Author in administrative capability.</li>
<li>Seperate OLTP processing from reporting.</li>
<li>Optimize</li>
</ol>

<p>The three-tiered application is a ubiquitous pattern for a solid design. The three tiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface</li>
<li>Business logic</li>
<li>Data access</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependency is straight down. The user interface depends upon the business logic. It feeds events from the user back into the business logic. It does not directly access the data. The business logic layer invokes the data access layer in order to read and write raw data from the database and other sources, like web services.</p>
<p>While this pattern successfully sheids the user interface from the raw data, it does not effectively sheild the user from the implementation.</p>
<p>Alan Cooper's book About Face 2.0: Essentials of User Interaction Design describes the difference between the implementation model and the conceptual model. The conceptual model is how the user thinks about the problem, and the implementation model is how the program solves it. The differences between the two cause confusion on the user's part, and bugs on the program's. The user interface's direct dependency upon the business logic means that the implementation of the business logic becomes visible to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
On several occasions, I have had the need to insert a fourth layer into an application. Between the user interface and the business logic, I have added an interaction layer. In this case, the dependency is not straight down: the interaction layer does not completely hide the business logic from the user interface. Instead, the interaction layer is the entry point into the business layer. It fills in the gaps when the conceptual model differs from the implementation model, but it steps out of the way when the two coincide.</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface</li>
<li>Interaction</li>
<li>Business logic</li>
<li>Data access</li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to inject this layer after the fact, so I have resolved to put it in place on every application, whether it seems to need it or not. The application might really be what-you-see-is-what-you-get. But just in case you need to see something slightly different, the hook is in place.</p>

<p>Yesterday I attended a presentation at the <a href="http://ddnug.net/">Dallas .NET User's Group</a>. Norm Headlam presented the Microsoft Patterns and Practices Web Service Software Factory (or Service Factory for short). You can download this tool from <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/practices">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/practices</a>. Follow the "Web Service Software Factory" link.</p>
<p>Norm demonstrated how the Service Factory generates a solution with a set of well-organized projects. It generates a service layer, a data contract, a business layer, and a data access layer. Each of these assemblies has one and only one role. The service layer defines the web service. The data contract defines the data types that are exchanged between the client and the server. The business layer contains all of your business rules. And the data access layer interfaces with the database.</p>
<p>No longer will you return a dataset from a web service. These layers are separated according to best practices.</p>
<p>Norm showed how the Service Factory offers ongoing guideance. It doesn't just generate this skeleton and leave you to fill it in. Instead, you right-click on your projects to add data objects, data containers, and service endpoints. As you work, the Service Layer keeps a log of your changes. And it gives you links to your most likely next step.</p>
<p>Web services are no longer generated from your code. Instead, your code is generated from your contracts. You can import a database schema as a data object in the data access layer. Or you can import an XML schema to generate an object in the data contract. This is not like NHibernate, where the data layer is generated at runtime from business objects. This actually does it the right way, where the stored procedures that your DBA authors are honored, and all code is generated at design time.</p>
<p>The only problem I have with Microsoft's Web Service Software Factory is the name. This is not a Software Factory.</p>
<p>According to the book (Software Factories: Assembling Applications with Patterns, Models, Frameworks, and Tools), a software factory is a set of tools that generate several products within a software product line. All products in a product line serve the same vertical domain. They are described using domain specific languages.</p>
<p>"Web services" is not a product line. It is a horizontal slice of software technology, not a vertical problem domain. And these tools, useful as they are, are not a domain specific language. I look forward to using Service Factory on a real project in the near future, but I will also continue to create software factories in the real sense of the term.</p>

<p>Colorful language is not terribly helpful in a bug report. The best quality assurance professionals document what they were doing, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. The outstanding quality assurance engineers probe deeper to find patterns. Let me tell you about one such individual: Chris Sachnik.</p>

				<h2><a href="index86fa.html?p=135" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The promotional model">The promotional model</a></h2>
				<small>June 29th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday I modified a Bugzilla entry to indicate that the change was ready for QA testing. QA responded that not only was the bug fixed, but it was also working in production. That's when I realized that the build that went to production the night before actually included my fix, before QA had had a chance to validate it. Our promotional tracking failed.</p>
<p>If you manage a live production system, you need a good set of procedures to define how changes are rolled out. It's a common problem. How do you control what changes to into production? How do you notify QA of all the bug fixes that they should be testing? How do you know what version of the software currently in QA? How do you pinpoint an issue to a particular build? Although the problem is a common one, it seems that every place I've worked has had a different solution.</p>
<p>The ideal solution is known as the promotional model. This is the world view whereby builds are promoted from one platform to the next. At a minimum, you need five:</p>
<ul>
<li>development</li>
<li>integration</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>staging</li>
<li>production</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these five platforms is to test different parts of the system with reasonable isolation. Programmers can test their individual features in development, and then make sure they don't break each other in integration. Meanwhile, QA is running regression tests on a stable build. The staging area is used to test the deployment process itself before it finally sees the users in production.</p>
<p>The promotional model forms a pipeline. A build of the software moves through this pipeline, stopping at each of the five platforms along the way. When it fails to pass the tests at a particular platform, it falls out of the pipeline and another build comes up behind it. No build proceeds to the next platform until it passes all tests at the previous platform.</p>
<p>The promotional model has no forks. So while it is likely that you will have different builds installed on different platforms at any given time, a build cannot pass another one in the pipeline. Unfortunately, this makes emergency releases extremely disruptive. If QA is testing the new features when you find a problem in production, you have to take the feature build out of the pipeline to allow the fix build to flow through. That means that QA has to stop testing new features in order to perform a regression test on the fix. I've been on teams that have tried to short-circuit this process to their own detriment. Just take it as a given that you will disrupt QA testing to push an emergency fix.</p>
<p>The promotional model is not the same as source control, but they do touch each other. The source control system is allowed to branch. This is necessary when a change needs to be applied to a build that occurred in the past. So while it is not possible for a build to pass another one within the pipeline, it is possible to push through a build from an older branch.</p>
<p>The promotional model is not the same as bug tracking, but they do touch each other. A bug is opened against the particular build currently installed on a particular platform of the pipeline. It should be possible to identify the exact branch and revision that were used to create the build in question. So it should be standard practice for a developer to pull the code in question before looking for the bug. It should be, but in my experience it rarely is.</p>
<p>The industry has known about the promotional model for many years. In fact, some source control systems claim to support the promotional model. They usually support this claim with branching and tagging features. It's not the same thing. To do promotion right, you should implement both source control and bug tracking, and then integrate them with a database that tracks builds through the pipeline.</p>

					<p>I work in the industry, so I can say it. Phones are weird.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that the iPhone plans have unlimited data, but a limited number of SMS messages? Don't they realize that we can just use web-based IM?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that a song in iTunes costs $0.99, while a piece of a song in a ringtones WAP deck costs $2-$5? Don't they realize that we can just drop an mp3 file in the right folder?</p>
<p>Have you ever called someone intending to leave a voice mail, only to have them pick up? Shouldn't we be able to choose to record a message rather than wait for the phone to ring four times and to listen to the greeting?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that you need a special app to get YouTube content on the iPhone? Isn't that a full version of Safari in there?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that the iPhone doesn't work with Exchange Server? How is this going to attract the executive Treo users who can afford to carry this status symbol?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that you usually buy your phone from your network provider? When's the last time you bought a computer from your ISP?</p>
<p>Have you noticed the missing feature on iPhone's maps? You have to enter a city name to do a search. Can't it tell where you are based on the towers it's connecting to?</p>
<p>With all of the entrenched economics and politics, phones just don't work the way they should. They are just weird.</p>

<p>If you're new to the show, then welcome. If not, then you probably know that I am a Java programmer by day, and .NET by night. So it may come as a surprise to you that I have purchased a Mac. I got a 15 inch MacBook Pro. The "entry-level" version with a 2.2 GHz processor, not the 2.4. And certainly not the 17 inch boat that frankly should come with a set of trucks so you can ollie and rail slide your way to work.</p>
<p>If you are not new to the show, then you probably know that I am passionate about quality. I'm on a constant quest for quality in my own software and in the software that I use. I've heard it said that people who love software want to build their own hardware, but I didn't really understand that until I used my new Mac. This thing was built to run quality software.</p>
<p>For one thing, you have the specs. This, like I said, is a 2.2 GHz laptop. It comes with 2 Gig of memory and a 5400 RPM hard drive standard. You can't choose anything less and still have a MacBook Pro. Apple just won't let you. Other manufacturers sell similar specs for the money, but their stuff appears less expensive because you can buy less machine.</p>
<p>For another thing, you have the screen. This 15.4 inch monitor has a 1440x900 resolution. That's the same as the 22 inch panel on my desktop. Do the math ... the not new among you know that I love to do the math ... and you see that this screen is twice as dense! Apple won't let you see a pixely picture. There's a reason that Safari looks bad on Windows ... it was designed for a Mac!</p>
<p>So this is hardware worthy of quality software. It begs for quality software. In fact, if you write crappy software for the Mac, nobody will use it. The Apple community has come to expect a certain level of polish on their apps. Sure, some of them only go skin deep, but at least the effort is visible. I use an open-source instant messenger called Adium, and even this little app has the clean simple look of OS X. It even has a gorgeous little green duck icon that looks great sitting in the dock next to the Garage Band guitar. I'm a Java developer, so I know. You're lucky if we replace the coffee cup. And when I'm writing a Windows app, 16 colors and a copy of Paint is good enough.</p>
<p>But you know that I can't live without my .NET. Having written in C#, I never want to go back to C++. The Mono Project isn't keeping up, so I, of course, installed Boot Camp and Vista on this baby. And let me tell you, it runs Vista like a dream. I can't imagine the heat that the Boot Camp team gets in Cupertino for writing Windows drivers, but they did an excellent job.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's not my intent to become a Mac bigot or to convince you to switch. I just know quality when I see it, and the not new know that I'm all about the user experience.</p>
<p>My name is Michael L Perry, and I run Windows on the Mac.</p>

<p><a atomicselection="true" href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/subclipse-problem-occurred.png"><img border="0" width="532" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/subclipse-problem-occurred-thumb.png" alt="Problem Occurred: cannot checkout" height="188" style="border: 0px" /></a></p>
<p>I have just tried to import a Team Project Set into Eclipse from an SVN repository using the Subclipse plugin. Checking the Console window in Eclipse, I see that the problem was an obstructed update. I already had a project directory by that name. I need to delete it first.</p>
<p>So the plugin already knew what the problem was. After all, it put the error message in a different window. It could have at least displayed it in the popup.</p>
<p>In this situation, there are two correct actions for the software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the problem itself (after prompting, since this would be a destructive fix), or</li>
<li>Tell me how to fix the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the only correct options, but at least displaying the error message would be a start.</p>
<p>Eclipse's plugin architecture may be to blame for this one. It is difficult to get different components to work together, especially if they were written by entirely different teams and integrated only on the user's desktop. Perhaps there was no easy way for the plugin to give its host enough information. Composite applications often turn into Frankenstein's Monsters. But Eclipse is usually better integrated than this.</p>

					<p><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/ais/AiS30.mp3">Listen Now</a></p>
<p>Charles Martin of <a href="http://beforeyouaregone.com/">Before You Are Gone</a> shares some of his time-tested web development techniques. And we even make some up on the spot.</p>
<p>First, consider creating separate servers. You need at least four. Start with a development server where the team can first integrate their code and see if it works. Then deploy to a test server where your QA team can exercise it. Practice your deployment on a staging area separate from the others so that you can be certain that you can upgrade the current production release to the next one. Finally, of course, you have the production environment, far removed from the others.</p>
<p>For the love, don't develop in production!</p>
<p>Second, the separation of style from content is essential to modern web development. Always create a CSS file rather than embedding style within the page. Understand how specificity determines how styles are applied to elements of a document. And to test your CSS file, consider creating a single template page that includes examples of all elements that you use in the entire site. This gives you one place to look to see if your CSS change affects anyone else.</p>
<p>And third, configure your environment to report all Javascript errors. Web browsers are very forgiving by default. They have to be because of all the legacy code that is out there on useful sites today. Since you don't have a compiler to check for errors, you have to rely on the browser to perform that function. Let it tell you about all the errors on your pages, and test each page on all major platforms. Now that we have Safari for Windows, the Mac - and the iPhone - cannot be ignored.</p>
