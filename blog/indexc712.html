		<description>I was there at Tech Fest myself and it was a pleasure.  You actually won something in the Microsoft raffle, but you weren't there so they moved on to the next person.

I was wondering if you were there as I wanted to introduce myself.  I took a position at Radiant  back in August 2007 and have been able to see a lot of the things you did and wanted to put a face with the name.</description>
