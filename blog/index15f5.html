		<description>I've noticed that I -- as well as people who really know how to use Linux -- tend to treat streams as if they were lists of objects. We'll use commands like "awk 'print { $6 }'" to extract values of specific properties. In fact, many of the Linux tricks I've learned are actually workarounds for the fact that streams are not lists of objects. It's good to see Microsoft taking it to the next level.</description>

		<description>And now someone is trying to convert THEM to the evil new child on the block, Windows Powershell (doesn't do YOU any good, but it's a pretty awesome tool. As usual, the Microserfs know what they're doing when they set out to steal and repackage the best work of others)</description>
