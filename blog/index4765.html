		<description>Thanks for joining me on the show, Charles. I hope you don't mind being credited as "special guest" on the intro and show notes :). The podcast is now on-line at &lt;a href="http://ais.libsyn.com/rss" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ais.libsyn.com/rss&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

		<description>Great job on the TalkShoe net cast, Michael.  Very interesting and well moderated.  

By the way, Hamachi doesn't have a beautiful simple client for the Mac OS; instead it is a console application.  So I may wait on it until it becomes a full fledged Mac app.

I'm also going to keep an eye out for any of those books by Alan Cooper.  I think it may prove useful in other projects as well. :)</description>
