		<description>Great idea, but an Engineering Notebook entry should NEVER be modified after the date on which the original entry was made, except to strike out items. Otherwise, why did you date the pages?   For instance, you did not write the date of each checkmark that was updated later in the week.  That activity, although efficient, invalidates the book for patent applications or most lawsuits.

This is still an excellent and useful way to keep notes, but is not what pro's mean by an "Engineering Notebook".</description>

		<description>Very informative post Michael. I am probably going to write a post about this one of these days. I've realized managing an engineering notebook is a really important habit to foster - especially with my software projects. One tool, especially in the brainstorming phase of a project is mind mapping. Really helps your mind "wander constructively". Keep up the great work.</description>

		<description>Jotting down things in your note book is a very healthy habit it sure helps inremembering things . If you use a little catch word only it triggers of your memories and rewinds it back.</description>
