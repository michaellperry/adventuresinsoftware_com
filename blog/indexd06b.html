				<small>Sunday, November 26th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The Windows file system has become a jumble of mixed concerns. What started out as a way of organizing information hierarchically has mutated into something that second-guesses users at every turn.</p>
<p>Case in point. I finished building my wife's new machine and started copying photos from mine. I left the process running for a while, then went back to my machine to check on its progress. I found a message on the screen asking if I would like to overwrite the file "Thumbs.db". As Alan Cooper says, the computer had gone stupid. Instead of doing something useful, like continuing to copy the files that it could, it stopped and waited for someone who wasn't there to answer a dumb question.</p>
<p>This, of course, happened because Windows creates an index file whenever you switch to thumbnail view. Her machine had the folder open in thumbnail view so that we could verify that the pictures were indeed being copied. So her machine created an index file, and my machine tried to push a new one to it.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is that the OS is using my file system for something other than my files. My intent is to store pictures in this folder, but the OS throws something else in for its own purpose. Who does this folder belong to, anyway?</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples of this. When you edit a Word document, the program creates a temporary tilde file in the same folder. This is used as a workspace while the program runs, and as a restore point if the program crashes. I once made the mistake of editing a Word document directly on a floppy disk (yes, it was that long ago) and removing the disk while editing. The program crashed soon afterward and the disk was left in an unusable state. I intended to put the disk back in prior to saving, but Word was using it for its own purposes.</p>
<p>Some source code control systems also exhibit this behavior. Visual Source Safe puts index files in all of your working folders. Subversion creates an entire subdirectory called .svn in each working folder. This makes it impossible to just check out a snapshot of the project, say for an automated build, and get a pristine copy. Or to check out of one branch in order to check into another. And what if, for some strange reason, a folder named .svn was actually part of my project?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
Just use your own database for information about a user's files. Leave the  file system alone. That belongs to the user.</p>
<p>Or better yet, put the user's documents into your database, too. The file system is just a confusing jumble of metaphors for the average user. The less they have to see it, the better their experience will be.</p>
<p>But in any case, don't put indexes in the file system.</p>

				<h3 id="post-53"><a href="index5fb3.html?p=53" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Electronic Voting Software">Electronic Voting Software</a></h3>
				<small>Wednesday, November 8th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diebold_Election_Systems">Diebold</a> terminal to vote in yesterday's election. All of the security issues aside (many of which have been covered elsewhere), I could not help but to critique their software as I was casting my ballot. I found that the system does some things well, but has a long way to go.</p>
<p>One of Alan Cooper's fundamental rules of user interaction design is that computerizing a real world metaphor makes it worse. You loose some of the features of the real world, and you take on none of the benefits of computerization. Case in point, the <a href="http://www.co.collin.tx.us/elections/election_information/2006/110706/ballots/BS_27.pdf">ballot</a> presented on the Diebold machine was made to look exactly like a paper ballot. It had boxes for the offices organized in three columns. Candidates' names were listed within the box. The boxes flowed down one column and jumped to the top of the next.</p>
<p>This ballot design was originally created for the mechanical punch system that electronic voting replaces. Columns work well in that system because that allows pages to open down the center and guide your stylus to a punch hole.</p>
<p>But columns do not work as well on a computer screen. The resolution of a display is much lower than that of paper, so text is naturally harder to read. To compensate, the voting terminal used a very large font. This caused text that would easily fit on a column of a paper ballot to sit uncomfortably within the similarly sized column of the on-screen ballot.</p>
<p>On the confirmation screen, the same layout was presented in a scrollable view. Because the flow was top-to-bottom then left-to-right, I found myself scrolling through the first column, then jumping back to the top to scroll the second column. Scrolling is bad enough with a mouse, but dragging your finger down a touch screen is terribly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A better metaphor for a computer screen is to take the entire width. Then logically group the offices so that an entire group fits on one page. Put tabs across the top of the screen to let you jump to any group, and put indicators on the tabs that are incomplete. There are advantages to columns on a paper ballot, but those advantages do not translate to the computer screen. I know that a committee determines the layout of the ballot, and that they have many legal and political constraints in which to work, but I didn't see any allowance given to the medium.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the check boxes had good affordance, meaning that it was obvious that you could tap them. They looked like they wanted to be selected, and they gave satisfying visual feedback when activated. A punch hole on a paper ballot is much smaller, although equally satisfying when pierced.</p>
<p>Eventually, all voting will be electronic. It's just going to take us some time to learn what paper metaphors to leave behind as we move to the digital medium.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, November 7th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As a geek, I like to retain control over my desktop (my computer desktop, that is; my physical desktop is a mess). So when Windows pops up and tells me that I have unused icons on my desktop, I usually ignore it.</p>
<p>Today, however, I decided to give it a chance. It identified two icons that I have never actually used (one of which was Network Neighborhood) and asked if I'd like to delete them. I said yes. Then instead of actually deleting them, it moved them into a new folder called "Unused Desktop Shortcuts" which it created ... on my desktop.</p>
<p>Windows weaseled out potentially useful feature for fear that it might make a mistake. They replaced two unused icons with one. The recycle bin is there for a reason. If I make a mistake, I can go there to undo it. Please don't add an interruption, three clicks, and extraneous thought to my day only to stop half-way.</p>

					<p>In Windows, open a folder and open "Tools: Folder Options...". Click on the View tab. The Advanced Settings is a scrollable list of options.</p>
<p><img title="folderoptions.jpg" id="image47" alt="folderoptions.jpg" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/folderoptions.jpg" /><br />
If I want to turn on known extensions, do I look under D for for "Display", S for "Show", or H for "Hide"?</p>
<p>The same metaphor appears in Word 2003. Go to "Tools: Options..." and click the Compatibility tab.</p>
<p><img id="image48" alt="wordoptions.jpg" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/wordoptions.jpg" /></p>
<p>This options are grouped by words like "Don't", "Surpress", and "Use". When looking for hanging indent tab stops, I won't be looking for "Don't".</p>
<p>The only explanation I can find for this metaphor is laziness, and not the good kind. Instead of taking the time to group and organize options for us, the developer just throws them into a checked list box. This is also an indicator of <a href="indexcbb6.html?p=41">feature indecision</a>. If you have so many options that you need to scroll through them, you have failed to decide how your features work.</p>

				<small>Monday, October 16th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here's a scenario that I've seen played out countless times. I recall a requirements meeting during which an issue came up about a new feature. The business analysts, software architects, and product managers present all had different opinions on the fine points of its behavior. All had valid opinions. The user might actually want the feature to work in any of the proposed ways. Nobody wanted to loose the argument by putting their opinions aside, so instead of choosing one we decided to ask the user what they wanted.</p>
<p>At first, we were going to ask via a modal dialog that appears when the user invokes the feature. Such pop-ups are hostile to the user experience, so it was changed to a checkbox on the screen that invoked the feature. However, this solution cluttered the UI, so we eventually buried it in a separate configuration window.</p>
<p>After the feature shipped, we received feedback that it behaved inconsistently. Sometimes it worked one way, and sometimes another. Apparently one power-user who knew about the configuration window was changing it, and all of the users who didn't were suffering the consequences.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that we failed to take responsibility for our product's behavior. As software designers, it is up to us to decide what a feature does. When we shirk that responsability, we create unnecessary complexity in the software. Complexity leads to confusion.</p>
<p>Now when I see feature indecision, I put a stop to it. Whenever someone recommends that we prompt the user, I ask if there is any way we can decide now. Sure, that means that some people leave the meeting "loosers", but the user wins in the end.</p>

				<small>Sunday, October 8th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>When my wife asks me to do something, she first tells me where to go, then what to get, and finally what to do with it. For example, today she told me "In the bathroom, under the sink on my side, there are some disposable wipes. Could you clean off that stain on the landing?" I, of course, had already cleaned off that stain, but with paper towels from the kitchen.</p>
<p>This exchange points out one key difference in our thinking. She is a process-oriented thinker while I am a goal-oriented thinker.</p>
<p>Quite often, she will ask me to help her with software. It might be a program that she has never used before, like when she was learning Picasa (now she is a Picasa guru). Or it might be a program so complicated that it is new to her every time she uses it, like Word. In either case, she tells me what she wants done (the goal), and I figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>When I'm finished, she asks me to repeat the steps for her. After that, she can execute that same process over and over again.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, programmers are goal-oriented. We have to be. The program is a blank canvas. We have nothing to help guide us except the requirements. There are many ways to accomplish the goal, and no one way is the right way.</p>
<p>Many other people are process-oriented. A lot of these people use our software. So when we programmers write software for ourselves, we alienate a large subset of our potential users.</p>
<p>A programmer will generally create a program with many tools that can be combined in uncountable ways to achieve any goal. Examples of these kinds of programs are Word, AutoCAD, and Photoshop. These tend to be very powerful programs that take a long time to learn. And, with the exception of one member of this class, they tend to be designed for specific audiences. AutoCAD is for engineers. Photoshop is for artists. Engineers and artists, like programmers, have to be goal-oriented. Word is the exception that proves the rule: almost everybody uses Word, but they tend to use only the surface features. When they need more from the tool, they turn to someone who has spent some time to learn its nuances.</p>
<p>Process-oriented users need a different style of program. They don't want to see a bunch of tools, they want to be taken step-by-step through their work. Examples of these programs are Picasa, SketchUp, and Quicken. (Two of these, you’ll notice, have been acquired by Google. Hmmm...) These programs have fewer features, but those features are targeted to specific goals. The important thing to notice is that process-oriented people have goals, and they recognize those goals. They just focus their work on the process instead of the goal itself.</p>
<p>The software development team is responsible for identifying the audience for their program. If they are developing for goal-oriented users, they should create a set of small tools that can be combined in multiple ways, and leave the goal up to the user. If they are developing for process-oriented users, they should discover the users goals ahead of time and design a process for each one.</p>

				<small>Thursday, September 21st, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>It takes a professional to design good software. As far as system design, I think most people would agree. It takes an experienced programmer or architect to know what is going to work and what isn't.</p>
<p>But when it comes to user interaction design, a surprising number of people think that they can get by without a professional. Many software interfaces are designed by programmers, some by business analysts, and a few by end-users. Most are not designed at all, but just evolve over many iterations of coding and testing.</p>
<p>Alan Cooper has written several books on user interaction design. I highly recommend About Face 2.0, a link to which can be found in the sidebar. He describes user interaction as the whole of a program's behavior from the user's point-of-view. This includes far more than the user interface, which is primarily concerned with how the program looks. So while a visual artist may be a member of a professional user interaction design team, many more disciplines are represented.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires a domain specialist, who understands the problems that the software attempts to solve. This person does not simply bring the existing process to the solution, but evaluates and suggests entirely new solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires a psychologist who understands how people think. This person ensures that the user's perception of the software is compatible with the way the software solves the problem.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires an ergonomics engineer. This person makes sure that the user is comfortable while using the product. He or she evaluates the user's special needs, such as the environment in which they will be working.</p>
<p>User interaction design also requires someone with experience specifically in software. This person is not a programmer, but rather someone who considers software from the user's perspective. They are abreast of current standards and capabilities, but they can also innovate beyond the norm.</p>
<p>Alan Cooper articulates much clearer than I can the problem with relying upon the wrong people to design software. Check out this <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=177721">video on Channel 9</a>.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, August 29th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>To be effective at my new job, I have learned my way around a Linux box. For my entire career so far, I've lived in an exclusively Windows environment. But now I've been introduced to a whole new world. I confess that it has been quite exhilarating.</p>
<p>The transition from Windows to Linux was a bit daunting at first, but one product helped me bridge the gap. Cygwin is a Unix shell that runs within Windows. You don't have to dual-boot. You don't have to install a new OS. You don't have to install a virtual machine. It just presents a bash shell as if it were a DOS command window.  (Other shells are available, too.)</p>
<p>What really makes Cygwin a winner is the ease with which you can install and upgrade it. Just go to cygwin.com, find a mirror near you, and run setup.exe. It will present you with a set of packages that you can install. Then it downloads only what you choose, so you don't waste time or bandwidth on features you won't use.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the shear number of packages available. If you don't know what you need, just take the defaults. When you discover that you need a new package, you can always run setup.exe again. It will remeber which mirror you chose last time, and will only download and install the new packages that you select. It couldn't be any easier.</p>
<p>Here are the packages that I use:</p>
<p>OpenSSH - secure shell and file transfer. I use this to access Linux servers running in the datacenter.</p>
<p>Nano - a simple text editor.</p>
<p>gcc - a C/C++ compiler. We use Java at work, but I expect to start a Linux C++ project at home.</p>
<p>Some friends from Radiant tried to convince me to use Cygwin before. I wish I had listened then. Sorry, John and Daniel!</p>

					<p>I love Cucusoft's iPod video converter. I can download movies from Channel 9 as WMV and convert them to MP4 for my video iPod. And for the most part their UI is fantastic. They provide a simple drag-and-drop mechanism for getting my videos into the pipeline.</p>
<p>But when they bundled two of their converters together into one suite, they made a big UI mistake in the process. Now when you close the main window, the following prompt appears:</p>
<p><img alt="Are you sure you want to quit?" title="Are you sure you want to quit?" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/areyousure.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is a wonderful application, but it is not so wonderful that I would never want to close it. There is no loss of information when the program shuts down, so this prompt is not protecting me from an irreversable operation. It's just an annoyance.</p>
<p>Cucusoft's is not the first app that I've seen make this mistake. My wife still uses B's Recorder Gold to back up her machine, and it has the same problem. I also remember this prompt from several early Visual Basic apps, but the community seems to have learned since then. I just wish everyone would take the lesson to heart.</p>
