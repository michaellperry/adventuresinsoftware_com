		<description>Check out something that this company called Gemalto has just released.
I found a video about it on you tube... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA8QZ7DvIts

Its called the Network Identity Manager....
I found very little info on it on gemalto.com/nim but i sent an email to them and someone replied asking what my needs were....

Explained to them and looks like it may solve the problem for our consumers.</description>
