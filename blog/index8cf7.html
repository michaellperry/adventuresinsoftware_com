			<h1>More Bad Behavior from iTunes</h1>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>I use iTunes to rip CDs, download podcasts, and synch my iPod. I use eMusic to purchase music. eMusic downloads to one folder, and iTunes manages another. In order to back up my music, I like to consolidate it all into the iTunes folder.</p>
<p>iTunes has a feature that does that for you. And it usually works. But today, this is what happened when I tried to consolidate my library:</p>
<p><img src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/itunescopyfailed.jpg" alt="Copying Music failed. The file name was invalid or too long." title="Copying Music failed. The file name was invalid or too long." /></p>
<p>Which file? Was it invalid, or was it too long? What would be valid? How do I fix this?</p>
<p>Or better yet, iTunes should just rename the file itself and save me the hassle of this error message.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>After deleting, reimporting, and reconsolidating small groups of tracks, I discovered the file that was troubling iTunes. The file name including the ".mp3" extension was 134 characters long. I had to shorten it to 130 characters before iTunes would consolidate it. If you run into this error message, give that a try.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong><br />
The comment from Torkel inspired me to write this quick application -- <a href="http://www.itunesfix.com/" title="iTunesFix">iTunesFix</a>. It is not a script, but a full-fledged .NET application. As such, it requres you to install the .NET framework and to trust that I haven't put anything evil in the exe. Run the program and browse for your iTunes Music Library.xml file. The program will scan the file looking for any file names that are over 130 characters in length. It will list them out for you to rename, delete, or otherwise manage as you will.</p>

			<p>Thanks so much! I found your site via Google and your solution worked like a charm!</p>
<p>iTunes needs to help the user identify exactly what file it is. Maybe someone should report that as a potential bug?</p>

			<p>Me too! Though Im still unsure how to go looking through every file to find one thats too long, theres zillions! and the whole point of wanting to consolidate it was put the folders all into one place... im concerned I may not be able to find the file thats causing this problem. this has never happened before either. Anyone have any other ideas??</p>

			<p>Yeah, you rock for posting this!</p>
<p>Tip for folks with this problem:<br />
If you look in the \My Music\iTunes\iTunes music folder you can see what iTunes managed to copy before the gates to hell broke down and a 130+ character file was found. It still sucks but it beats looking through <i>every</i>file on your computer..</p>
<p>anybody know how to script this? I would know how to do it in perl I think, besed off the itunes xml file. but perl isn't default on windows so it wouldn't do normal people much good now would it..</p>

			<p>This worked me:<br />
To find the song that was too long, I sorted the songs in my library by DATE ADDED. (right clip at the top next to play count) This is the order that iTunes consolidates your library. And I went through the songs to find the last song that didn't copy over. This is the song that is 'too long.' So then all you have to do is delete it or shorten it.</p>

			<p>Martin,</p>
<p>Did you delete the file using Windows, or using iTunes? If you just delete the mp3 file itself, then iTunes will still have a reference to it in its database. This will appear as a gray exclamation point in iTunes next to the song.</p>
<p>If you did delete the song using iTunes, then there is apparently another reason for a file name to be invalid. iTunesFix.exe is only designed to find file names that are too long. Please let me know if this is the case and I'll research it further. I may need you to send me your iTunes Music Library.xml file, if that's OK.</p>

			<p>Hi, I downloaded your program, set it up, even had a bit of trouble with the missing mallardsoft file but fixed that, only to run itunesfix, have it scan for half a second and then display nothing. now itunes still won't consolidate the library and i have no idea why. any thoughts?</p>

			<p>Von Patty,</p>
<p>Martin has reported a similar problem. He has sent me his iTunes Music Library.xml file so I can try to reproduce the problem. It seems that filename length is not the only thing that can cause this problem. I'm going through the file looking for anything else that might be the culprit.</p>
<p>So far it looks like it might be an HTTP file in the library. If you use eMusic, it looks like they leave on-line samples in your library that cannot be consolidated. Let me know if this seems like your issue. If I can confirm this behavior, I'll update the program accordingly.</p>

			<p>I downloaded your program and it worked great. Found 13 files with long names out of +7000 songs! I changed the filename in Windows Explorer and then re-linked to the shorter named file from iTunes, but I still get the error message when I try and consolidate. I'm guessing that I've got some odd characters in some of the filenames.... any suggestions? have you written another version of your program that flags filenames with "bad" characters?<br />
Appreciate any help you can provide.<br />

			<p>Great program! On my machine, though, it missed several that were too long that I had to find and rename to a shorter name manually before my library would consolidate. I think this is because I was working with a second iTunes library which instead of in "My Music\iTunes" was in "My Music\iTunes 80 GB iPod Library (using)". So instead of 130 characters max I'm guessing my system would probably only be able to deal with names up to 105 characters or so in length. For a future version, I'd love to see a dialog box where the user can change the default 130 character cutoff to something shorter (like 105 in my case) if he/she needs to (or a command-line option). Thanks again for a great and useful program!</p>

			<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>Thank-you very much for the info about this error. You are on the right track with 130 however I am now down to 120 and reducing. There must be some arbitrary number? Perhaps associated with the directory length? Have you further updates on this? I see the 1st was 2007. Very much appreciate your efforts with this.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the script, although unfortunately it didn't work for me as it didn't isolate all the files with long names for some reason.  I was scratching my head and couldn't figure out why.  This approach did work for me though.  Manually Conslidating, and then inspecting the XML for any old links, truncating the filenames and repeating. </p>

			<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to determine what else might constitute a filename that is too long or invalid. If you happen find out which file is causing the trouble, then perhaps we can figure out what about it is invalid. Then I can update the script.</p>

			<p>Hi, The program worked great-- it found the same long names I found by manually looking at the itunes.xml file. I was not sure whether the long artist,title, album etc. name in itunes was the problem or the actual file name of the .mp3 file in the library  or all these combined, so I shortened all the names as follows.</p>
<p>1.) Get the list of long names by running the itunesfix.com program. For each song in the list, do the following:<br />
  a,) search for song in itunes and find it<br />
  b.) shorten any long names in itunes<br />
  c.) right click on song to get "info" and pointer to where .mp3 file is located<br />
  d.) use windows explorer to rename the .mps file to a smaller name<br />
  e.) Try to Play the song in itumes.  It will not find song so manually locate the new shorter .mp3 name</p>

			<p>OMG man, when I saw that error, my heart dropped because I MUST consolidate in order to transfer music to my new computer. Then my head started spinning about whether I should try one of those ipod-to-computer programs. But I had already taken up ALOT of space on my already strained old computer by consolidating until it quit on me midway thru. I was at a loss until coming across this totally simple script thing.

			<p>It runs with the Windows Script Host. If it doesn't launch when you double-click the js file, then you can try extracting it, right-click, and select "Open With : Microsoft (R) Windows Based Script Host". If that option is not available to you, then you can try running "wscript ConsolidationFix.js" from the command line where you extracted the file.</p>

			<p>I have a slightly different but similar problem so I tried the consolidator fix.  Unfortunately it did not help to fix my problem.  </p>
<p>The problem that I have is that whenever I try to open iTunes Program I get an error message that says: The iTunes Application could not be opened.  The filename is invalid or too long.</p>
<p>Microsoft told me to use a program called Revo Uninstaller Pro to remove all iTunes files and applications this included iTunes, Quicktime, Bonjour and at least three others.  Revo also takes care of cleaning up file entries that were left behind in the registry and throughout the computer.  After this I restarted and tghen reinstalled iTunes results same.</p>
<p>Microsoft also did not hesitate to also tell me to contact the iTunes supplier to get them to fix their problem.</p>
<p>I am running a PC with Vista Home 32bit.</p>
<p>Please help I have a new iPhone that I would like to setup and need iTunes to get my mail and contacts installed.</p>
