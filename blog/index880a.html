		<description>I like that title as it is something we can apply in many areas, not just programming.  For example, getting our spending cut down to something within our budget begins with the "kernel of certainty"; in this case, it is that we need shelter, food and transportation.  Of the three, the only one without limit seems to be food.  This is because it can vary based on how much you decide to cook for yourself, or heat up for yourself or just flat out have someone else cook it and put it on the tray/table/sack.  To bring food back within a kernel of certainty means planning out a menu that will be adhered to (barring any emergencies or other unexpected situations).  Once you get these three into your kernel of certainty, then you branch out into debt reduction and so on.  However, without gaining that kernel, you end up never being able to get your arms around it all.</description>
