		<description>Hey Joseph,

Yeah it was a blast. And the ODC was fun as well. I'm currently working on the audio of the finals.

I recorded everything with an Olympus voice recorder. I could have gotten much better sound quality out of a more expensive device, but I'm doing this for the love. For the finals, I experimented with an external microphone, which helped just a little.</description>

		<description>This audio provides great insight into the Sleepless in Dallas event. Thanks for posting it. It really was a crazy cool weekend!

Hey Michael, congrats on the win by the way you are the man! We got 2nd place barely, but your team was great and deserve the win. I look forward to hearing about your San Jose competition.

The audio is hilarious at 27:35 with the blue screen of death and the keyboard beeping while Derek bangs on the keyboard! ha ha.

Here is my post on the event:

Question, how did you record all that audio? what device did you use?</description>

		<description>Hey Michael, how do we contact you with questions?  I didn't see an email address or 'contact me' form.  I have a question about your RSS feed and Wordpress.

		<description>Hey Now Michael,
It sure was a stellar weekend. Good luck in Cali! Your podcast is really great, it's playing now I've only heard the first part but its sound good. I know we talked about listening to DNR. This was some good content for a podcast, I'm so glad you published it. 
Nice 2 meet you,
