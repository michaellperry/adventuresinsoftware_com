		<description>I for one am looking forward to hearing (reading) your thoughts on this subject and hopefully seeing your code as well. The object relational impedance mismatch is a well known, and hard, problem, but it sounds like you may be approaching things from a different perspective...it should be interesting.</description>

		<description>Yes, there are tools to do the conversion for you. There's NHibernate, LLBL Gen, Entity Framework, and many other ORMs for C#. And for XML, .NET already has some good tools for both parsing and generating documents.

Still, you have to turn the corner. The tools write a lot of the code for you, but you still end up with several representations of the same object. Instead of transforming an object, I'm creating a framework in which there is only one object. It doesn't matter if it is in the database, in memory, or on the wire. These objects always obey the same set of rules.

I've already coded parts of the system both in Java and in C#. By the time I'm done, even the language won't matter.</description>

		<description>Isn't there already an ORM (object relational mapping) tool for C#?  I'm coming from the JAVA side where we use Hibernate to presist our objects to a database.  It also looks like you need to represent the object as xml.  You might be on your own for that one, but essentially, you're just serialing the object as xml and that should be a solved problem already with all the work done with SOAP.  I'm just trying to save you an awful lot of work.</description>
