		<description>This was so much help! I have been sitting here for hours following steps about opening itunes library with notepad, finding first song etc. And none of them worked! However I downloaded this program and within 5 seconds it had found the faulty file and I fixed it!

This program and its creator deserved massive credit, this should be on the itunes website!</description>

		<description>This worked really well. Note to self - change the file names in the source, not the itunes names. Would have saved me some time.</description>

		<description>i made a little progress..

 i copied the entire 11Gb folder to the c drive and called it c:\itunes music

 then in itunes  Edit-Preferences-advanced and changed the itunes media location to this.

this has shortened all of the filenames by 5 directories or about 61 characters.

it will now try and consolidate, but duhhhh it hasnt got enough hard drive space now:-    there is not enough room on 'C' to copy all of the requested files

so am backing up the unconsolidated directory to external before deleting</description>

		<description>my copying files failed message came up immediatly when i clicked consolidate. 

  The little download did not work for me.

 i read through loads of peoples posts (thank you all for your help) right clicked the top bar and sorted by date added. i then just tried to play the tracks from the start and the first six could not be played:-


the Song "blah bah" could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it? 

it also had a liitle exclamation mark icon next to it i deleted these in itunes

so i played through all the tracks (2100) quickly  cursor down and enter took about 50 mins and found a few more deleted these restarted itunes and.....

it still does not work.... HELP!!!</description>
