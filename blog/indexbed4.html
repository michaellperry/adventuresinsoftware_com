		<description>Thanks for the incredible work. I am using it in my web site but there is one problem. When I run in IE 8, the images do not slide smoothly. They flicker when moving. With other browsers it works perfectly. Has anyone faced this problem. Please let me know what should be done. Thanks.</description>
