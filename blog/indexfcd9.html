				<small>Thursday, January 10th, 2008</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Sometimes you have to act like you don't understand.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo"><img style="padding-right: 3px; padding-left: 3px; padding-bottom: 3px; padding-top: 3px" src="../../upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Columbo.jpg/200px-Columbo.html" align="right" /></a> My friend and former colleague from Radiant John Howison is a master of this technique. Having just seen <a href="http://www.tv.com/columbo/agenda-for-murder/episode/101408/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;51">Columbo: Agenda for Murder</a>, I thought I would give it a try.</p>
<p>I just started a new engagement. My role on this project is not coder, not architect, but analyst. It is my job to document the requirements such that they are useful to the technical team. It is my job to ask questions.</p>
<p>Columbo was a fictional police detective who gathered information not by intimidation, and not by brilliant displays of intellect, but by acting like he didn't understand. He could always get people to give him information that they might otherwise withhold or ignore. Since that's my job on this engagement, I'm trying the same technique.</p>
<p><strong>Admit that you are not the domain expert</strong>     <br />In Agenda for Murder, Columbo put a secretary at ease by telling her that he didn't know how to use a fax machine or office telephone. Not only did he tell her, but his questions showed that he was no expert. He let her see that she had expertise that he himself didn't have. Once she was in that position, she slowed down and explained every detail of their operation. The key to solving the mystery might have been in those details.</p>
<p>Had he tried to show off his intellect and be superior to the secretary, she might have been less willing to talk to him. She might have just glossed over the details, since the Lieutenant must already know them. And so he might have missed some valuable information.</p>
<p>I've admitted to my client that he is the domain expert, not me. I've asked some stupid questions that proved that point. I didn't deliberately set out to ask stupid questions, but neither did I refrain from asking in case they <em>were</em> stupid. I'm not in an intelligence competition with my client, so I don't mind looking like I don't know something. It just encourages him to slow down and explain every detail.</p>
<p><strong>Don't let an assumption go unchallenged</strong>     <br />The premise of the show was that the murderer went to great pains to make the deed look like a suicide. Walking in on this scene, most people would make the assumption that it was, in fact, a suicide. That assumption would blind them to facts that say otherwise. People tend to bend facts to match their preconceived assumptions.</p>
<p>But Columbo did not allow this assumption to stand. As he walked into the crime scene, a fellow officer was relating the details that they discovered so far. In his tone and language, he indicated that it was a suicide. Columbo corrected him, taking away the veil of the assumption. With this new vision, he was able to spot quickly the evidence that indicated murder.</p>
<p>Walking into this engagement, I took stock of the assumptions I was making about the problem domain. Every fact that I use had to be backed up by a conversation of document that I exchanged with the client. If not, I document that assumption. Twice a day, I go through this list in person with the client. Usually my assumptions are correct, but we've already caught some rather large and dangerous misunderstandings this way.</p>
<p>But sometimes the assumption is the client's. It's difficult when talking to just one person to differentiate fact from assumption. Talking to more than one person and walking through scenarios verbally can help.</p>
<p><strong>Ask the same question of multiple people</strong>     <br />Columbo asked the suspect for details about the night of the murder. He then asked his alibi for the same details. There were, of course, slight discrepancies. These details may or may not have been important, but there was no way to know.</p>
<p>Columbo, of course, is trying to catch someone in a lie. I'm not expecting my clients to be deliberately withholding information from me, but each person has their own perspective on the project. Each person has their own goals, and their own experiences. These color the facts that they give me. By asking, I'm not looking for <em>the</em> answer, just <em>their</em> answer.</p>
<p><strong>Walk through everything out loud</strong>     <br />In the show, Columbo verbally walked through the suspect's description of events on the night of the murder. The suspect described how he received a phone call from the victim, how he sounded desperate, and how he declined to help. Columbo rewound the conversation and restated the &quot;facts&quot;. He asked what was said that sounded so desperate. With this walkthrough, the suspect told him that the victim said &quot;What am I going to do&quot; twice and hung up. This is a detail that was not revealed in the first telling.</p>
<p>Later the suspect tells Columbo that he received a second call that night. Columbo reminds him that his wife only heard the phone ring once, so he claims that the call came in on call waiting. The fact that the victim hung up puts the lie to the suspects claims. But without walking through the scenario to extract details and establish timing, Columbo wouldn't have had this information.</p>
<p>I've verbally walked through the process with my client several times now. He provided use cases, which is a fantastic starting point, but they are no substitute for a live, personal, verbal walkthrough. Each time we go through it, I learn something new. Sometimes it's a detail in the use case that I missed. Other times, it's new information that I then add.</p>
<p>It's easier to act smart than to act dumb. Instead of posturing, I have to check my ego and realize that my client is smarter than me. And so far it seems to be effective. Although I have yet to produce any significant documentation, my client tells me I'm asking good questions.</p>

<p>The blood of the consultant is the billable hour. And I report my hours to four different systems. Every week, my manager gets a progress report, the firm gets a time sheet, the project manager gets task updates, and the client gets a summary. Each of these systems has a different focus, and requires a slightly different view of the data.</p>
<p>If only timekeeping could be simple. Joel Spolsky proposed a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000245.html">painless system</a> many years ago. I wish we could adopt something simple like this, but many business and political forces conspire to make the problem harder than it has to be.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
Since all of these systems must agree, I've created one database to rule them all. And since they all have different goals, I've created different views of this database. Each view of the data is an aggregate. I've carved up the problem space so that each view has the granularity it needs.</p>
<p>Every one of these time systems (including Joel's, BTW) tracks time from the task hierarchy. Many tasks make a project, and many projects are billed to a client. Each system has different cut points within this hierarchy to pull out and aggregate relevant data.</p>
<p>But the task is not the correct dimension of measure for a time tracking system. The correct dimension is time (go figure). When you keep track of work by task, you loose the history of what was worked on when. But when you keep track of work by time, you can aggregate by task in order to calculate progress.</p>
<p>It's sort of like trying to balance your checkbook by looking at your budget rather than your register. The budget is a useful summary, but it lacks the historic detail necessary to keep different systems in sync.</p>
<p>So I keep track of hours in an Access database. Each week I run queries to view the data in different ways to produce each of my different reports. With this system, I can spend less time billing hours and focus on delivering quality software.</p>

				<small>Thursday, September 20th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I started my software career working for ESystems, an aviation contractor now part of Raytheon. There, I had a mentor who taught me how the software business worked. Sure I could sling some code. That was my hobby through high school and my major in college. But he taught me how software was done in the real world.</p>
<p>One of the skills he taught me was keeping an engineering notebook. I've adapted his system over the years, but the spirit of his system is still present.</p>
<p><strong>Composition style</strong><br />
I start with a composition notebook. Some people choose to use graph paper, while others like the elegance of <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_notebooks.htm">Moleskine</a>, but a simple composition notebook works for me. Do not use loose leaf paper, a legal pad, or a spiral notebook, as you should never be tempted to remove pages.</p>
<p>Keep a separate notebook for each project. You can have just one for your employer, if you like, but definitely separate that from your personal projects. I even go so far as to keep my personal projects separate from each other, even though that means I have a few books on my shelf with only the first three pages filled in.<a href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/notebook.jpg"><img src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/notebook-thumb.jpg" id="id" style="border: 0px none " alt="Notebook" align="right" border="0" height="244" width="228" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Record the date</strong><br />
I start each morning by entering the date. By its very nature the engineering notebook is chronological, so embrace it.</p>
<p>I also record the first date on the cover of the notebook. When I run out of pages, I'll record the end date as well. Unfortunately, chronological organization means that I always have to look things up by date, but this information is usually available.</p>
<p><strong>Task hierarchy</strong><br />
Under each date, the notebook is a list of trees. At the root of each tree is a task. A task might be a feature, a bug, a research item, or anything else that is small enough for me to finish within an hour or two. Below that, I'll use indentation and lines to break down the task into individual units of work. Lines are especially useful for carrying the hierarchy from one page to the next.</p>
<p>Next to each entry, I'll use symbols to indicate progress. A check mark means done. An open box means that the unit of work is done but needs to be tested. It gets a check mark after the test passes. I put a star by information that I'll probably need in the future. An arrow means that it'll get done later. An arrow pointing to someone's initials means that I've delegated the work to them. An arrow pointing to a vertical line means it'll probably never get done. My system of symbols has evolved over time, but it pretty much covers all of the situations I need.</p>
<p>If I get interrupted, I'll start a new task tree for the new task, leaving the old one hanging. When I get back to the original task, I start a new tree below the interruption. This is the only practical solution in a paper-based system. And it is also a good way to measure the frequency and cost of interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Reference numbers</strong><br />
I use reference numbers to cross-reference items outside of the notebook. Whenever I check in some code, I write down the revision number in parentheses. Whenever I work on a bug, I write down its ID with a pound sign. And when I prepare a change for deployment, I write the ticket number underlined. I can't count the number of times that I've been able to glance at my notebook during a meeting and find exactly the information I need because of this system.</p>
<p><strong>Pull it forward</strong><br />
Once a week I go back through the notebook to find tasks that have not been checked. If they have been finished, I'll check them off. If they can be delegated or ignored, I'll do so and make the appropriate notation. If they still need to be finished, I'll write them under the current date. I'll then draw a box around all of the tasks that I've carried forward. This gives me a backlog that I can refer to quickly to ensure that tasks don't slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>We deal with far too much on a daily bases to keep everything in our heads. I've found that this system helps me to act more like a professional by maintaining a history of important facts and tasks in a portable and accessible package.</p>
<p>What is your system?</p>

<p>Colorful language is not terribly helpful in a bug report. The best quality assurance professionals document what they were doing, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. The outstanding quality assurance engineers probe deeper to find patterns. Let me tell you about one such individual: Chris Sachnik.</p>

				<small>Friday, June 29th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday I modified a Bugzilla entry to indicate that the change was ready for QA testing. QA responded that not only was the bug fixed, but it was also working in production. That's when I realized that the build that went to production the night before actually included my fix, before QA had had a chance to validate it. Our promotional tracking failed.</p>
<p>If you manage a live production system, you need a good set of procedures to define how changes are rolled out. It's a common problem. How do you control what changes to into production? How do you notify QA of all the bug fixes that they should be testing? How do you know what version of the software currently in QA? How do you pinpoint an issue to a particular build? Although the problem is a common one, it seems that every place I've worked has had a different solution.</p>
<p>The ideal solution is known as the promotional model. This is the world view whereby builds are promoted from one platform to the next. At a minimum, you need five:</p>
<ul>
<li>development</li>
<li>integration</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>staging</li>
<li>production</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these five platforms is to test different parts of the system with reasonable isolation. Programmers can test their individual features in development, and then make sure they don't break each other in integration. Meanwhile, QA is running regression tests on a stable build. The staging area is used to test the deployment process itself before it finally sees the users in production.</p>
<p>The promotional model forms a pipeline. A build of the software moves through this pipeline, stopping at each of the five platforms along the way. When it fails to pass the tests at a particular platform, it falls out of the pipeline and another build comes up behind it. No build proceeds to the next platform until it passes all tests at the previous platform.</p>
<p>The promotional model has no forks. So while it is likely that you will have different builds installed on different platforms at any given time, a build cannot pass another one in the pipeline. Unfortunately, this makes emergency releases extremely disruptive. If QA is testing the new features when you find a problem in production, you have to take the feature build out of the pipeline to allow the fix build to flow through. That means that QA has to stop testing new features in order to perform a regression test on the fix. I've been on teams that have tried to short-circuit this process to their own detriment. Just take it as a given that you will disrupt QA testing to push an emergency fix.</p>
<p>The promotional model is not the same as source control, but they do touch each other. The source control system is allowed to branch. This is necessary when a change needs to be applied to a build that occurred in the past. So while it is not possible for a build to pass another one within the pipeline, it is possible to push through a build from an older branch.</p>
<p>The promotional model is not the same as bug tracking, but they do touch each other. A bug is opened against the particular build currently installed on a particular platform of the pipeline. It should be possible to identify the exact branch and revision that were used to create the build in question. So it should be standard practice for a developer to pull the code in question before looking for the bug. It should be, but in my experience it rarely is.</p>
<p>The industry has known about the promotional model for many years. In fact, some source control systems claim to support the promotional model. They usually support this claim with branching and tagging features. It's not the same thing. To do promotion right, you should implement both source control and bug tracking, and then integrate them with a database that tracks builds through the pipeline.</p>

<p>Charles Martin of <a href="http://beforeyouaregone.com/">Before You Are Gone</a> shares some of his time-tested web development techniques. And we even make some up on the spot.</p>
<p>First, consider creating separate servers. You need at least four. Start with a development server where the team can first integrate their code and see if it works. Then deploy to a test server where your QA team can exercise it. Practice your deployment on a staging area separate from the others so that you can be certain that you can upgrade the current production release to the next one. Finally, of course, you have the production environment, far removed from the others.</p>
<p>For the love, don't develop in production!</p>
<p>Second, the separation of style from content is essential to modern web development. Always create a CSS file rather than embedding style within the page. Understand how specificity determines how styles are applied to elements of a document. And to test your CSS file, consider creating a single template page that includes examples of all elements that you use in the entire site. This gives you one place to look to see if your CSS change affects anyone else.</p>
<p>And third, configure your environment to report all Javascript errors. Web browsers are very forgiving by default. They have to be because of all the legacy code that is out there on useful sites today. Since you don't have a compiler to check for errors, you have to rely on the browser to perform that function. Let it tell you about all the errors on your pages, and test each page on all major platforms. Now that we have Safari for Windows, the Mac - and the iPhone - cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>If you’ve taken a course in analysis of algorithms, then you’ve learned how to prove that an algorithm will have a certain result. You’ve proven that quicksort will terminate, that it will actually sort the list, and that it will complete in n log n time. But in the real world, all of the sorting and searching algorithms are already written. We no longer need to prove algorithms. Now we need to prove designs.</p>
<p><strong>Cycle of discovery</strong><br />
Programmers tend to work in a code-test cycle. We’ll write some code, then we’ll see if it does what it should. Then we’ll go back and change the code and test again. The cycle continues until the feature is complete. This is a cycle of discovery. This is how we explore new things. This is the scientific process. This is not how other engineering professions work. Sure, it gets the job done, but it’s not the most efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>Agile development techniques put new labels on the cycle of discovery. Now instead of code-test we have red-green-refactor. But it’s still the same cycle. We don’t know ahead of time that the code we are about to write is correct. We just keep typing until it works. In this world you don’t know how close you are to the finish line until you cross it. How are we ever to estimate our work? Or mitigate risk?</p>
<p>Would you buy a house from someone who says, “let’s just keep nailing boards together until it looks like a building”? Of course not. But most software is more complex than a house. It takes longer to build. It has more moving parts. It’s more expensive. We should be doing at least as much as a home builder to ensure that we will deliver the right product, at high quality, on time, and on budget.</p>
<p>We can do that by proving our design.</p>
<p><strong>Cycle of proof</strong><br />
In my day-to-day work, I follow a different cycle. I’ll learn the requirements of a feature, design the feature, code it once, and then fix bugs. I don’t spin in a tight code-test cycle. Once I know what the design should be, I just sit down and write it all out. Sure, I may have bugs and typos, but they tend to be easy to fix. I may go days between compiles, but in the end I know that it will work. I know because I’ve proven it.</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal">We have entered the vicious stack of crises. This is the cycle of issues that follows the most-recent top-priority law. This stack is not strictly LIFO, however. If the PM receives a call regarding an issue further down the stack, it is escalated to the top.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span>Our stack is currently three issues deep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The new features are a week late. But they have to slide because the fix that we pushed to production on Friday didn’t work. We told our customer that the problem would be solved before the weekend, so now they are breathing down our necks for an estimate on the real fix. But we can’t work on that now because the new build is bringing down the QA servers and they can test.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is in times like this that I look for my kernel of certainty. Instead of tackling the chaos head-on, I need to start from an island of sanity. I need to find one piece of the system that I can trust implicitly. From there I can reach out to other components and bring them under control.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the moment, I can’t trust MySQL. Two of these issues may be related to the database itself doing something unexpected. I need to bring something else to bear on the problem. Unfortunately, I can’t trust Log4J right now, either, because it wasn’t accepting my configuration changes on the live production server. So I have to retreat one step further. Right now my island consists of Java, Eclipse, MyEclipse, and JBoss running on my own box. And JBoss is in danger of being voted off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once I pare the world down into its most sane parts, I can start to extend my reach of confidence out to Log4J. When that is again within my control, I’ll bring that to bear against the MySQL problem. With visibility that I can trust, I may find that I solve all three crises simultaneously. However, I won’t find a solution by attacking each issue directly, with their priorities shifting, using tools in which I have no confidence.</p>
