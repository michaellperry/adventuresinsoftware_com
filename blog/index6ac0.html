		<description>I could find any Linq to Entities sysntax in VB for this case. The soultion we came up with was to wrap the query in a try...catch.. end try and catch the InvalidOperationException and set the variable to zero.</description>

		<description>Yeah, it's really annoying, same problem with LINQ to SQL. In the MSDN doco they state that this was deliberately done to align with T-SQL / SQL Server, which returns NULL for aggregates over an empty set. I presume they may have followed the same reasoning for Entity Framework. It deliberately goes against the LINQ to Objects implementation though.

Definitely one of the more annoying leaks to come out of these two technologies - surely the framework could do this for us? The runtime knows what type we want back so if Sum() gets a value type and the underlying provider returns null, wouldn't it simply be a case of saying 'if (result == null) return default(T)' somewhere, instead of making the client code jump through nullable hoops?</description>
