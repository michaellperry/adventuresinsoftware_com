				<h2><a href="indexdb4e.html?p=118" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to XmlSerializer Correction">XmlSerializer Correction</a></h2>
				<small>May 12th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I mentioned in episode 23 XMl Inside Out that there was no attribute in .NET that would flatten a collection. Raymond and I stumbled upon just such an attribute accidentally.</p>
<p>The issue was that all legs of a flight were direct sub elements of the "Flight" element. Serializing an array puts all of those legs under an intemediate "Legs" element. However, if you use the attribute [XmlElement("Leg")] instead of [XmlArray("Legs")], you will get a flat collection.</p>
<p>The point is still valid, however, that you will find some schemas that you cannot match with XmlSerializer. It was designed to be really easy, not really flexible. These two goals are often at odds with one another.</p>

				<h2><a href="index8320.html?p=117" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to AiS 25: Case Study: SSG">AiS 25: Case Study: SSG</a></h2>
				<small>May 9th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/ais/AiS25.mp3">Listen Now</a></p>
<p>Raymond and I have been working on a time crunch project for the past week. We take a break from our design work to discuss the project so far. We've been fortunate to work with an experienced team of professionals -- SSG -- who understand how to make a softawre project succeed.</p>
<p>SSG pulled together an exhaustive requirements document. This document is an outline-numbered list of line items, each one describing one functional aspect of the system. The requirements document gives the team a common set of goals from which to work. It doesn't explain exactly how each of these functional requirements are met. That job is left to the user experience designers.</p>
<p>SSG hired a user experience design team to construct a conceptual model of the system and translate that into a series of wire frame designs. A wire frame shows the visual components that comprise a system, but don't attempt to make those components attactive. For that, SSG has hired user interface designers.</p>
<p>The user interface design team is skilled in graphic design. They provide the artistic talent to make the user experience look good. That leaves Raymond and myself on product development. We are primarily responsible for making the system work.</p>
<p>SSG was seeking a parallel workflow between user interface design and product development. They chose to use Windows Presentation Foundation to separate those two processes. However, Raymond and I decided that the introduction of such a new technology to such an urgent project would add too much complexity. So we advised that we use Update Controls instead.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we may be able to bring WPF back into the project after the demo. It seems entirely reasonable that a XAML document could lay out Update Controls in addition to the more typical components. This should give us the best of both worlds: parallel development tracks and isolation of user interface components.</p>
<p>One other developer is involved in the project. While Raymond and I are creating the user facing parts of the system, an employee of SSG is working on integration with custom hardware. To mitigate risk on this integration, we designed an interface ahead of time. The interface accepts memento objects instead of business objects to further mitigate the risk of changes to the interface. Whereas business objects are likely to change, mementos tend to be more stable.</p>
<p>The design and techonogy decisions that we've made are driven by not only the requirements of the system, but also the structure of the team that is building it, and the time table in which it must be delivered. In future episodes we'll delve into some of the detail of design and implementation, and let you know how the project is progressing.</p>

<p>16 bytes is the length of a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID). Here's one I just generated: "{37B317CC-6036-4037-8E26-0A239103BC2B}". This GUID has never been generated by any computer at any time in history, and will never be generated again.</p>
<p>I can use this arbitrary number to represent anything I want. I can say this is the ID of a new COM interface I design, or a new ActiveX control I author. I can use this as the primary key of a new row I add to a database table. Since it is globally unique, there is no chance of collision if I merge with another database.</p>
<p>There are  3.4 x 10^38 possible 16 byte numbers. They are more rare that they originally seem.</p>
<p>Your social security number is 9 decimal digits. There are only 1 billion of those. It's a much shorter number.</p>
<p>16 bytes can be a trade secret.</p>

				<h2><a href="index0a10.html?p=115" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to How to use email">How to use email</a></h2>
				<small>May 3rd, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As a public service, I offer ten rules of email. Apply them and be happy. Ignore them and others will suffer.</p>
<p><strong>How to read email</strong></p>
<p>Consider the source.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before reading even the subject line, read who the message is from. This helps put the message in context.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider your place.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you in the To line or the Cc line? Is the message addressed to a large group of people? If you are the only one in the To line, then consider the message important. If you are in the Cc line, you probably don't need to act upon it. If it was sent to a mailing list, then it can probably be ignored.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read from the bottom up.</p>
<blockquote><p>Scroll to the bottom of the message to see where the thread began. And even the most recent message can be read backwards. The call to action is usually in the last two sentences.</p></blockquote>
<p>Move messages out of your inbox.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you have acted upon a message, move it to a folder. If you can't act upon it right away, move it to an "open issues" folder.</p></blockquote>
<p>Organize folders by issue, not by sender.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's easy to set up rules and folders by sender, but it's not terribly useful. Email threads involving different people will get fractured. It's better to keep emails on a common thread and about a common issue in the same folder.</p>
<p>Create one folder for open issues and another folder for closed issues. Whenever a new issue arises, create a new subfolder for it within open issues. When the issue is resolved, move the folder to closed issues. If you have a multi-stage process, create a folder for each stage. For example, I have five parent folders named "0 Open", "1 Checked In", "2 Test", "3 Production", and "4 Closed".</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How to write email</strong></p>
<p>Don't manage through email.</p>
<blockquote><p>Email is far to easy to misinterpret. If you allow for interpretation, your employees are guaranteed to take it in the worst possible way. If you have a problem with one specific employee, call him to the carpet. If something is important enough to say to all your employees, it should be said in a company meeting where they can ask questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't reply to all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't be "that guy".</p></blockquote>
<p>Delete all but the last two sentences.</p>
<blockquote><p>After reviewing your carefully crafted message, summarize it. Then delete all but the summary. The email should contain only a call to action and enough supporting material for the recipient to follow up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Give tangents their own thread.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the subject line or set of recipients no longer fits, start over. Include only the people who care, and pick a subject line that fits. For example, if you receive a request to review a document, don't reply to all with your comments. Instead start a new thread with only the sender, and identify the issue in the subject line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Call your audience to action.</p>
<blockquote><p>Always let the recipient know what you expect them to do. Make this the first (and prefferably last) sentence in the message.</p></blockquote>

<p>Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of code without changing its behavior. Martin Fowler coined the term when he wrote the book on the subject. Not only does the book define refactoring and describe when to use it, but it also provides a catalog of recipes for refactoring code. By iteratively applying these transformations to a system, Fowler says that you can evolve the design of existing code.</p>
<p>I use refactoring in my day-to-day coding, but not in the way that Fowler recommends. I design my software systems up front. I don't expect the design to evolve into a good solution. However, I will often use the automated refactoring built into tools like Eclipse as a way to edit code. The tool is a faster typist than I am, and it won't make a mistake due to a copy/paste fumble.</p>
<p>Refactoring, as most agile development techniques, works best when you have a small team of talented developers working in uncharted territory. Agile techniques move the methodology out of their way and allow them to be talented. However, if you know where you are going, it is much better to draw up a plan to get there.</p>

				<h2><a href="index8820.html?p=112" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Constrained dot-chaining">Constrained dot-chaining</a></h2>
				<small>April 26th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For my recent XML parsing library -- <a href="index3f5a.html?p=100">DeclarativeXMLParser</a> -- I used a coding technique that I call constrained dot-chaining. This technique is useful for creating structures in code that more concisely express their intent.</p>
<p>Simple dot-chaining is accomplished by declaring methods that end in "return this". For example, StringBuffer in Java and StringBuilder in C# both facilitate dot-chaining by returning "this" from the "append" (or "Append" in C#) method. Thus you can chain a series of method calls as in:</p>
<pre>String greeting = new StringBuffer()
  .append("Hello, ")
  .append(name)
  .append("!")
  .toString();</pre>
<p>Notice the use of the dot at the beginning of the line. As compared to the more typical dot at the end of the line, this lends more symmetry to dot-chained code and works better with intellisense.</p>
<p>Dot-chaining is especially powerful when you pass the resulting object as a parameter. The object can be created and initialized in-line with no semicolon. No variable needs to be declared.</p>
<pre>throw new MyException(new StringBuffer()
  .append("Failed to open  file ")
  .append(fileName)
  .append(": ")
  .append(e.getMessage())
  .toString(), e);</pre>
<p>Constrained dot-chaining is useful when the order of operations should be restricted. For example, in the DeclarativeXMLParser, each element will be initialized before the attributes are matched. The attributes will be matched before the Begin delegate is called. Begin will precede the sub elements, and End will follow all. So you want the code to look like this:</p>
<pre>new Element()
  .Init(delegate() {...})
  .RequiredAttribute("id", idAttribute)
  .IgnoreOtherAttributes()
  .Begin(delegate() {...})
  .One("subElement", new Element()
    .RequiredAttribute("name", nameAttribute)
  )
  .End(delegate() {...});</pre>
<p>Unconstrained dot-chaining would allow these operations to be declared in any order. While that wouldn't confuse the parser engine, this would most certainly confuse anyone reading the code. Constraints are required to force this code to be more readable.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
The Element class is only the leaf of a long line of inherited classes. It directly supplies the Init method, which returns Element. It's base class is ElementWithAttributes, which supplies all of the attribute related methods. ElementWithAttributes in turn inherits ElementWithFilter, which supplies the Filter method, and so on up the hierarchy until you reach ElementWithEnd.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. Once you go up the inheritance hierarchy, you can't go back down. This forces you to call the methods in the prescribed order. Inheritance allows you to skip levels if you want to, but you can't backtrack.</p>
<p>Each level of the hierarchy returns its own type for methods that can be called more than once, and its base class type for methods that can be called only once. So, for example, once you call Begin, you are now at the ElementWithContent level. You cannot call Begin again because you are too high up in the tree.</p>
<p>Download the code for more details. I hope you find this technique as useful as I have.</p>

				<h2><a href="indexbbbb.html?p=111" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Protocol Monopolies are Dangerous">Protocol Monopolies are Dangerous</a></h2>
				<small>April 23rd, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The recent blackout of BlackBerry service has taught us a few lessons. <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/14352">Paul McNamara</a> points out the importance of transparency. <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/04/23/blackberry-outage/">Merlin Mann</a> warns us about techonogy addiction. But there is another lesson that I'd like us to learn from this experience: protocol monopolies are dangerous.</p>
<p>Almost 3 years ago, NTP sued RIM over their infringement of its push-email patent. The case dragged on, and threatened to terminate the service that many consumers had come to rely upon. RIM eventually <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/03/technology/rimm_ntp/index.htm">settled with NTP for $612 million</a>, ensuring that the service would continue.</p>
<p>Until this recent interruption, that is.</p>
<p>If not for the government sponsered monopoly that we call US patent law, competing services would have been available. RIM's customers would still have suffered, but their competitors would still have been operational. BlackBerry users would have been able to hold their service provider accountable, since they could switch to a competing platform. NTP once held its monopoly power over RIM's head, and now RIM holds it over us.</p>
<p>The Internet, with all of its flaws, is built on open standards. The protocols are well documented and not encumbered by patents. Any service provider is able to implement these protocols, and thereby (theoretically) interoperate with other service providers. For the most part, this works. And when it doesn't, we have the opportunity to hold our service providers accountable until they make it work. The Internet has no single point of failure (except perhaps DNS, but that's a discussion for another day).</p>
<p>When a service provider is given a legal monopoly over a protocol, the entire Internet suffers. Inventions and business processes can be patented, but protocols should be excluded. Until the law is changed, I encourage you to trade in your BlackBerry for a Windows Mobile, or some other device that can check email via the open protocols.</p>

<p>XML is not a religion. XML is a tool. A religion tells you what is right and what is wrong. A tool is only concerned with what is useful.</p>
<p>At the 2007 Dallas Code Camp, I presented 4 different XML parsing strategies currently available in .NET. XmlDocument is easy to use and supports input as well as output, but it loads the entire document into memory. XPathDocument is just as easy and slightly faster, but it is read-only. XmlSerializer is the easiest of all since it works with the .NET type system, but it tightly couples your data types with the schema and doesn't support all schemas. And XmlReader is the fastest and most powerful, but incredibly difficult to use.</p>
<p>I added a fifth strategy called DeclarativeXmlParser. This library wraps XmlReader with a dot-chained schema declaration that makes XmlReader dirt simple to use. This library and the demonstration code used in the presentation are available at <a href="http://dirtsimplexml.com/">http://dirtsimplexml.com</a>.</p>
<p>This presentation was inspired by work that I do at <a href="http://express.handmark.com/">Handmark</a>, and data provided by <a href="http://oag.com/">OAG</a>. Additional information was found at <a href="http://support.softartisans.com/kbview.aspx?ID=673">Softartisans</a>.</p>
