		<description>Great article. Thnx a lot. I was looking for hours to understand the mechanism. However in visual studio 2010, I had to check whether it is a postback or not, in order to see the report, otherwise it was trying to load in an infinite loop. For more info, one can read also here http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brianhartman/archive/2010/03/21/reports-never-stop-loading-with-vs-2010.aspx

Thnx again for the great article.

		<description>This is an absolutely brilliant article and exactly what I've been looking for!
Spent an entire day Googling, came back into work the next day and came across this page after a few clicks.
Many thanks for publishing this - it is something that should definitely be on MSDN by default.</description>

		<description>Michael, thanks very much for this excellent article, amazingly this is the only good, clear and simple explanation of consuming SRSS from an asp.net web app (I couldn't find anything on MSDN for example), if the SRSS is on a different unconnected domain. The example of the NetworkReportServerCredentials class is excellent, and has enabled me to use a SRSS web reference ReportingService2010 class to retrieve reportlisting to enable user selection...(is this something you've considered?), something like this...

        internal static ReportingService2010WebReference.CatalogItem[] GetNavBarGroupForReportFolder(string reportDir, string groupTitle)
        {
            ReportingService2010WebReference.CatalogItem[] result = null;

            ReportingService2010WebReference.ReportingService2010 rs = new ReportingService2010WebReference.ReportingService2010();
            rs.Credentials = new NetworkReportServerCredentials("username", "password", "domain").NetworkCredentials;
            result = rs.ListChildren(reportDir, false);

            return result;
        }

cheers mate, great work
