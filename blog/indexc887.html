		<description>[...] If there are two ways of expressing the same idea, then the object&#8217;s interface is bloated (see Necessary and Sufficient). The constructor should only set a value only if it can be set in no other way. It&#8217;s parameters should be those things that do not change over the course of an object&#8217;s lifetime.

		<description>I haven't coded to the Plam OS, but it sounds like getObjectPtr is a necessary function that has no alternative. And it certainly sounds like the OS would have been better had it included that basic functionality itself.

The type of convenience method that I'm talking about is one that has an alternative. The method simply saves the programmer a little typing. For example, the constructor for java.io.FileReader is overloaded to accept either a java.io.File object or a string. Either form specifies the file name. The File object itself has a constructor that takes a string. So the following lines of code are equivalent:

FileReader reader = new FileReader("input.txt");

FileReader reader = new FileReader( new File( "input.txt" ) );

The cost of this convenience is a bloated API, which implies a larger footprint, more to learn, and confusion. How do I really know that these two forms are identical? Could they have some subtle difference?

It also makes the maintenance path more obscure. If I started off using the more convenient form, and now want to load the input file from a subdirectory, the path isn't obvious. But if I started with the longer form, I could just add a parameter to get this:

FileReader reader = new FileReader( new File( "sub", "input.txt" ) );

or better yet:
FileReader reader = new FileReader( new File( new File("sub"), "input.txt" ) );

The convenience hides degrees of freedom that may be important to later modifications. Therefore, I assert that there should be one way to express any given idea, and that the API should contain only those methods necessary and sufficient for that expression.

Thanks for the question.</description>

		<description>Hi,
but I dare to pose one question:

Whats bad about centralizing convinience functions? In the Palm OS world, every product contains a function called getObjectPtr(in fact, its almost considered a part of the API).

If Palm had included that call into its OS, apps would be smaller and code would be simpler to reuse...

Best regards
