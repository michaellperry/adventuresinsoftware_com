		<description>Re: "ComponentModel" and "Component Model" is treated as equal

That is not happening for me, using diffmerge.  Whitespace between two words is definitely different than nothing between them.
Did you maybe have some other non-displaying whitespace character in there? (hard to acheive but possible).

Also, you can specify some other comparison tool instead of diffmerge, such as winmerge (a long-time favorite of mine) or whatever compare/merge tool you are happiest with.
I know that despondent feeling "they made me move from VSS to TFS" but hey, solutions are there, just not obvious... or easy... like you would have expected...</description>

		<description>I tried it and found funny behavior: "ComponentModel" and "Component Model" is treated as equal.
In other words, I have to forget about this feature.

So far, TFS source control is one big disappointment for me. Difficult fine tuning (see this example), drastical changes in the workflow etc.
I wished I could have stayed with VSS.</description>
