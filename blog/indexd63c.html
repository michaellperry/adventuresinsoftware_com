		<description>For more detail on the Transaction axiom, I direct you to a prior post: http://adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/?p=262. For more, click on the "historic modeling" tab above.

The Transaction axiom is the foundation for a synchronization framework I've started called "Correspondence". It models objects as a graph of partially ordered transactions. It's an interesting experiment.

I'll see if I can find more on Ownership.</description>

		<description>This is a good summation. I'm still unclear about Ownership and Transaction. I'll re-read your longer explanations to help with context.

What if we start trying to boil these down to statements of law like:

Law of Object Interface Identity
An object is identified by its interface which defines its behavior consistently</description>
