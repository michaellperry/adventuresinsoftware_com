		<description>Some data processing systems have a "cost" associated with pulling information from the data warehouse for reporting purposes which is charged back to the client.  This cost can play a significant role in which method is less prohibitive in the eyes of the budget ninjas.  A large download of data used for number-crunching may be less expensive than hundreds/thousands of small queries running throughout the day.

In addition to the budgeting of such transactions, the large download can be timed so that it has a lessened impact on live processing.  Overnight updates can be performed much faster when other processing is in a lull, reducing the "cost" of the download even more than a "quick" query running during peak hours.</description>
