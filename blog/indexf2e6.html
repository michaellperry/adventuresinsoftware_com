				<h2><a href="indexba52.html?p=39" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Your iPod Software is Too Old">Your iPod Software is Too Old</a></h2>
				<small>October 12th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>You may have heard that Apple has released a major update to iTunes. In fact, they have already released a patch for that update. I've been following the community response of iTunes 7 (now 7.01) to learn when I should take the plunge. By all accounts, it is still too early. Since I am still on iTunes 6, I don't know whether the following problem have been corrected.</p>
<p>When you plug your iPod into your PC (I can't attest to the Mac behavior), iTunes will automatically synchronize your music, podcasts, and videos. Very convenient. So convenient, in fact, that I often plug in my iPod and walk away from the machine. Recently, however, I have returned to my machine to find this error message:</p>
<p><img alt="iTunes too old" title="iTunes too old" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/itunes.jpg" /></p>
<p>(If the image does not appear, the text reads "Some of the items in the iTunes music library were not copied to the iPod "Mike's iPod" because your iPod software is too old. Go to www.apple.com/ipod/download to get the latest iPod Updater.")</p>
<p>When I press OK, the iPod synchronization commences. When it finally completes, all of my songs, podcasts, and videos are properly synchronized. I don't know which items it was complaining about because they all seem to have been copied to my iPod. This is what Alan Cooper calls "stopping the proceedings with idiocy." There are a number of lessons we can learn from this error message.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never display a modal error message during a long-running operation. The user is probably away.</li>
<li>If you must display an error message concerning "some of the items," list those items.</li>
<li>Never tell the user that there is a problem when there isn't one.</li>
<li>Never use an error message as an opportunity to promote a software upgrade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until I hear that iTunes 7 is solid, or better yet that a fully-integrated alternative exists, I will just have to put up with this idiocy.</p>

				<h2><a href="index4837.html?p=37" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Mathematical Where Clause">Mathematical Where Clause</a></h2>
				<small>October 10th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here's a trick that I learned from a database guru: instead of using "SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE x", consider using "SELECT SUM(IF(x, 1, 0))". He calls this a mathematical where clause, because it simulates a where clause with an aggregate function.</p>
<p>The idea is that a SELECT statement can have only one WHERE clause. If you want to count different subsets of rows using COUNT(*), you have to run a different SELECT statement for each one. That could cost you some performance if your WHERE clauses don't line up with indexes, because each SELECT statement performs another table scan. However, you can combine multiple subsets into one SELECT statement by writing different SUMs. Then, it does all of the counting in just one table scan.</p>
<p>Today I wrote some code to aggregate logs over time. I wanted to capture the total number of requests, as well as the number of failed requests. I solved the problem using a mathematical where clause:</p>
<pre>SELECT command, COUNT(*) AS total_requests, SUM(IF(result!=200, 1, 0)) AS failed_requests
&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM log
&nbsp;&nbsp;GROUP BY command</pre>
<p>And this trick can be combined with other aggregate functions to produce even more interesting results. Instead of just adding up 1s, you can aggregate any value you want. Just put the value on the positive side of an IF. But be careful about what goes on the negative side. Whereas a 0 has no effect on a SUM, it has a devistating effect on functions like MIN or AVG. For those, use a NULL. Aggregate functions ignore NULLs.</p>
<p>For example, I added another column to my select statement to return the smallest and largest valid results. I added the following to the statement:</p>
<pre>SELECT ... MIN(IF(result=200, response_size, NULL)) AS min_result,
&nbsp;&nbsp;MAX(IF(result=200, response_size, NULL)) AS max_result ...</pre>
<p>A 0 wouldn't mess up the MAX, but I used NULL for consistency with the MIN.</p>
<p>As always, please carefully consider the impact of this technique on your performance. Mathematical where clauses cannot take advantage of indexes. So if your conditions line up with indexes, go ahead and use multiple SELECTs. That way you can avoid the table scan altogether.</p>

				<small>October 8th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>When my wife asks me to do something, she first tells me where to go, then what to get, and finally what to do with it. For example, today she told me "In the bathroom, under the sink on my side, there are some disposable wipes. Could you clean off that stain on the landing?" I, of course, had already cleaned off that stain, but with paper towels from the kitchen.</p>
<p>This exchange points out one key difference in our thinking. She is a process-oriented thinker while I am a goal-oriented thinker.</p>
<p>Quite often, she will ask me to help her with software. It might be a program that she has never used before, like when she was learning Picasa (now she is a Picasa guru). Or it might be a program so complicated that it is new to her every time she uses it, like Word. In either case, she tells me what she wants done (the goal), and I figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>When I'm finished, she asks me to repeat the steps for her. After that, she can execute that same process over and over again.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, programmers are goal-oriented. We have to be. The program is a blank canvas. We have nothing to help guide us except the requirements. There are many ways to accomplish the goal, and no one way is the right way.</p>
<p>Many other people are process-oriented. A lot of these people use our software. So when we programmers write software for ourselves, we alienate a large subset of our potential users.</p>
<p>A programmer will generally create a program with many tools that can be combined in uncountable ways to achieve any goal. Examples of these kinds of programs are Word, AutoCAD, and Photoshop. These tend to be very powerful programs that take a long time to learn. And, with the exception of one member of this class, they tend to be designed for specific audiences. AutoCAD is for engineers. Photoshop is for artists. Engineers and artists, like programmers, have to be goal-oriented. Word is the exception that proves the rule: almost everybody uses Word, but they tend to use only the surface features. When they need more from the tool, they turn to someone who has spent some time to learn its nuances.</p>
<p>Process-oriented users need a different style of program. They don't want to see a bunch of tools, they want to be taken step-by-step through their work. Examples of these programs are Picasa, SketchUp, and Quicken. (Two of these, you’ll notice, have been acquired by Google. Hmmm...) These programs have fewer features, but those features are targeted to specific goals. The important thing to notice is that process-oriented people have goals, and they recognize those goals. They just focus their work on the process instead of the goal itself.</p>
<p>The software development team is responsible for identifying the audience for their program. If they are developing for goal-oriented users, they should create a set of small tools that can be combined in multiple ways, and leave the goal up to the user. If they are developing for process-oriented users, they should discover the users goals ahead of time and design a process for each one.</p>

				<h2><a href="index5c90.html?p=35" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Separation of Concerns in Ant">Separation of Concerns in Ant</a></h2>
				<small>September 25th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In a <a href="index3c55.html?p=28">previous post</a>, I wrote about separation of concerns in various software tools. One of these was Ant. Since that time, I have come up with a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>To recap, the problem is that an Ant script defines two perpendicular dimensions of a build: actions and projects. Actions depend upon other actions, and projects on other projects. The work occurs at the intersections of these two dimensions, where an action is applied to a project.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
The first step is to completely parameterize the actions so that they can be applied to any project. The locations of source files, the names of target jar files, and the classpath can all be specified as properties. Create a separate "actions.xml" file for these targets. The actions do not depend upon one another. These dependencies will be handled at a higher level. For example:</p>
<pre> &lt;property prefix="project" file="${home}/project.properties" /&gt;  &lt;!-- Get the source files. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="get"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Set Defaults --&gt;
  &lt;property name="branch" value="trunk" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="revision" value="HEAD" /&gt;
  &lt;svn username="${username}" password="${password}"&gt;
   &lt;checkout url="https://svn.mallardsoft.com/svn/productline/${branch}/${project}/" revision="${revision}" destPath="${temp}" /&gt;
  &lt;/svn&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;!-- Compile the java sources. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="compile"&gt;
  &lt;javac srcdir="${src}" destdir="${classes}" debug="${debug}"&gt;
   &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement path="${project.libs}" /&gt;
    &lt;pathelement path="${project.depends}" /&gt;
   &lt;/classpath&gt;
   &lt;include name="**/*.java" /&gt;
  &lt;/javac&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;!-- Jar the classes. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="jar"&gt;
  &lt;jar destfile="${dist}/${project.jar}.jar"&gt;
   &lt;fileset dir="${classes}" /&gt;
   &lt;fileset dir="${src}"&gt;
       &lt;exclude name="**/*.java"/&gt;
   &lt;/fileset&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>The second step is to create a properties file for each project. Paths are specified as colon-separated lists. I've already loaded two additional properties files that specify the locations of library and project jar files:</p>
<pre>jar=business_layer
libs=${lib.logging-log4j}:${lib.xerces}
depends=${proj.database_layer}</pre>
<p>The third step is to create a target for each project in your regular "build.xml" file. The target sets the "project" property and calls a target in "actions.xml":</p>
<pre> &lt;target name="database_layer"&gt;
  &lt;ant antfile="actions.xml" target="${target}"&gt;
   &lt;property name="project" value="database_layer" /&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;target name="business_layer" depends="database_layer"&gt;
  &lt;ant antfile="actions.xml" target="${target}"&gt;
   &lt;property name="project" value="business_layer" /&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;target name="web_interface" depends="business_layer"&gt;
  &lt;ant antfile="actions.xml" target="${target}"&gt;
   &lt;property name="project" value="web_interface" /&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;target name="swing_interface" depends="business_layer"&gt;
  &lt;ant antfile="actions.xml" target="${target}"&gt;
   &lt;property name="project" value="swing_interface" /&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;!-- Invoke the same target in all projects. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="all" depends="web_interface,swing_interface" /&gt;</pre>
<p>The fourth step is to define targets in build.xml that invoke the same action on all projects. These targets specify the dependencies among actions"</p>
<pre> &lt;!-- Get all projects. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="get"&gt;
  &lt;antcall target="all"&gt;
   &lt;param name="target" value="get" /&gt;
  &lt;/antcall&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;!-- Compile all projects. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="compile" depends="get"&gt;
  &lt;antcall target="all"&gt;
   &lt;param name="target" value="compile" /&gt;
  &lt;/antcall&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

 &lt;!-- Jar all projects. --&gt;
 &lt;target name="jar" depends="compile"&gt;
  &lt;antcall target="all"&gt;
   &lt;param name="target" value="jar" /&gt;
  &lt;/antcall&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>The designers of Ant probably never intended their tool to be used in this way, but it separates the actions from the projects. Now I can tweak an action for all projects in one place. Or I can add new projects and get all actions applied to it.</p>

				<h2><a href="index1e7e.html?p=34" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Professional User Interaction Design">Professional User Interaction Design</a></h2>
				<small>September 21st, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>It takes a professional to design good software. As far as system design, I think most people would agree. It takes an experienced programmer or architect to know what is going to work and what isn't.</p>
<p>But when it comes to user interaction design, a surprising number of people think that they can get by without a professional. Many software interfaces are designed by programmers, some by business analysts, and a few by end-users. Most are not designed at all, but just evolve over many iterations of coding and testing.</p>
<p>Alan Cooper has written several books on user interaction design. I highly recommend About Face 2.0, a link to which can be found in the sidebar. He describes user interaction as the whole of a program's behavior from the user's point-of-view. This includes far more than the user interface, which is primarily concerned with how the program looks. So while a visual artist may be a member of a professional user interaction design team, many more disciplines are represented.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires a domain specialist, who understands the problems that the software attempts to solve. This person does not simply bring the existing process to the solution, but evaluates and suggests entirely new solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires a psychologist who understands how people think. This person ensures that the user's perception of the software is compatible with the way the software solves the problem.</p>
<p>User interaction design requires an ergonomics engineer. This person makes sure that the user is comfortable while using the product. He or she evaluates the user's special needs, such as the environment in which they will be working.</p>
<p>User interaction design also requires someone with experience specifically in software. This person is not a programmer, but rather someone who considers software from the user's perspective. They are abreast of current standards and capabilities, but they can also innovate beyond the norm.</p>
<p>Alan Cooper articulates much clearer than I can the problem with relying upon the wrong people to design software. Check out this <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=177721">video on Channel 9</a>.</p>

				<h2><a href="indexdd23.html?p=33" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Definitive Behavior">Definitive Behavior</a></h2>
				<small>September 18th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A constructor is often said to initialize an object. But in my experience I have found that constructors are much more than that. They are the first method to be called in an object's lifetime, and you can call only one. So these special methods have earned more respect than to be treated as mere initializers.</p>
<p>The word "initializer" implies that the method sets the initial value of member variables. It is assumed that these variables can change their values at any time. But if a constructor is an initializer, then it is merely a convenience. There is no difference, say, between these two pieces of code:</p>
<pre>Person person = new Person("Michael", "Perry);</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>Person person = new Person();
person.FirstName = "Michael";
person.LastName = "Perry";</pre>
<p>If there are two ways of expressing the same idea, then the object's interface is bloated (see <a href="indexc7e3.html?p=31">Necessary and Sufficient</a>). The constructor should only set a value only if it can be set in no other way. It's parameters should be those things that do not change over the course of an object's lifetime.</p>
<p>I have found that objects have three types of behavior. The kind that we are most familiar with is dynamic behavior: things that can be changed. A member variable represents dynamic behavior because I can change its value (and therefore the behavior of the object) at any time. The FirstName and LastName properties of the Person class in the above example are dynamic.</p>
<p>The second kind is dependent behavior: things that depend upon other things. Dependent behavior is usually manifested as read-only member functions. They don't change the object; they calculate some value based on the state that the object already has. We might add a read-only FullName property to the Person class that concatenates the first and last names.</p>
<p>The third kind is definitive behavior: things that don't change during an object's lifetime. An object is constructed with this behavior, and it will keep it until it is destroyed. These behaviors are represented as constructor parameters, and often as read-only properties ("getters"). If they are values, they are usually identifying attributes, such as database keys or IDs. But quite often they are references to objects of larger scope, such as a business object for a UI component, or a storage provider for a message queue.</p>
<p>The best practice I've found is to avoid overloaded constructors. Reserve the one and only constructor for definitive behavior. This clearly documents to the users of the class that you have only one chance to set these values. You can only call one constructor. Use it wisely.</p>

				<small>September 14th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A good interface contains only the methods that it needs. The interface has enough methods to accomplish its task: the set methods is sufficient. In addition, the interface does not have any methods that it doesn't need: the set of methods is necessary. If you find that an interface has unnecessary methods, you should remove them. And if you find that it is insufficient, you must add to it.</p>
<p>A good contract is also both necessary and sufficient. A contract is more than the set of methods (the interface) that a type supports. It is also the constraints: preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. If it has unnecessary constraints, then there are otherwise valid situations that violate the contract. If it has insufficient constraints, then the contract allows some invalid situations.</p>
<p>A good unit test suite is also both necessary and sufficient. If it has unnecessary tests, then it is harder to maintain than it could be. If it has insufficient tests, then it won't detect all defects.</p>
<p>The balance of necessity and sufficiency is found all throughout mathematics. Software, being a form of applied mathematics, inherits this trait. Something that achieves this balance is beautiful to behold.</p>
<p>Two examples of this balance in literature can be found in my recommended book links. Euclid's Elements is the foundation for modern mathematics. He provides a small number of axioms, and from those he derives a large number of theorems. The axioms are necessary and sufficient to describe all of geometry. Bertrand Meyer's Object-Oriented Software Construction contains example after example of necessity and sufficiency in software contracts. Pay close attention to his Stack type.</p>
<p>Examples of software that do not achieve this balance are abundant. Many parts of the JDK have "convenience methods", which by definition are unnecessary. The SOAP specification is an insufficient contract, which leads to many interoperability problems.</p>
<p>Achieving this balance takes time. Only with experience can we hope to get there. It's something I strive for every day.</p>

				<h2><a href="index9cd7.html?p=29" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Dependency Analysis">Dependency Analysis</a></h2>
				<small>September 9th, 2006 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>If you are doing any serious Java development, especially if you are using third-party libraries, you will want to keep track of your dependencies. Not only does a successful deployment requires all components, but interdependencies help determine the maintainability of a system.</p>
<p>Java jar files are not as strict as other deployment methods, such as DLLs. A jar file will load even if one of its dependents is not in the class path. An exception will only be thrown at run time when and if a jar accesses another that is not available. Without good dependency analysis, you will have to test every feature to ensure that you haven't missed one.</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring a smooth deployment, dependency analysis can identify parts of the system that are resiliant to change. Components that others depend upon cannot be easily changed, while those that no others depend upon can be modified. Robert Martin, one of my favorite authors, describes this phenomenon better than I can in <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf">OO Design Quality Metrics</a>.</p>
<p>Kirk Knoernschild has created <a href="http://www.kirkk.com/main/Main/JarAnalyzer">JarAnalyzer</a> to discover dependencies among jar files. Not only does it help you to ensure that you package all prerequisite components, but it also uses dependency to calculate metrics according to Robert Martin's methods. I have incorporated this tool into the build process at Handmark as one more measure of quality.</p>
<p>One caveat. Dependency analysis tools cannot easily discover relationships through reflection. A common pattern for loading a class is:</p>
<pre>Class.forName("com.adventuresinsoftware.example.MyClass");</pre>
<p>This runs the static initializer for the class. But since the class name is in a string, anayslis tools cannot trace it. I use this pattern instead:</p>
<pre>com.adventuresinsoftware.example.MyClass.class.getName();</pre>
<p>It has the same effect, it is tracable, and as an added bonus you get compile-time validation and intellisense.</p>
