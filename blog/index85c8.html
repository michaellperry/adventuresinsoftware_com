				<small>Wednesday, September 5th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I love my iPod. And I'm certainly looking forward to the new iPod touch. But it appears that it is missing a feature that I use often on my fifth generation. Any iPhone owners reading this want to confirm?</p>
<p>I use the on-the-go playlist to queue up songs based on my mood. You can hold the center button to add a song, album, or even another playlist to the on-the-go playlist. And you can do this while the on-the-go playlist is playing. So it works like a queue.</p>
<p>But think about the UI for this. I browse my library for the first song, hold the center button until it flashes, the go out, out, out, into the playlists, into the on-the-go playlist, and pick the first song (the one I just picked from the library). Only then does it start playing. Now I go out, out, and back to my library to add more songs. From this point on, it works as I would like it to, but it took quite a bit of excise to get started.</p>
<p>So why doesn't the on-the-go playlist just start playing after the first song is added? In fact, why not just add the current song to the playlist if I select the next one. That would make my iPod work like a jukebox: the current song finishes before it starts my next selection. That would keep me in my music-listening mood instead of forcing me to think about the UI.</p>

					<p>I work in the industry, so I can say it. Phones are weird.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that the iPhone plans have unlimited data, but a limited number of SMS messages? Don't they realize that we can just use web-based IM?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that a song in iTunes costs $0.99, while a piece of a song in a ringtones WAP deck costs $2-$5? Don't they realize that we can just drop an mp3 file in the right folder?</p>
<p>Have you ever called someone intending to leave a voice mail, only to have them pick up? Shouldn't we be able to choose to record a message rather than wait for the phone to ring four times and to listen to the greeting?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that you need a special app to get YouTube content on the iPhone? Isn't that a full version of Safari in there?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that the iPhone doesn't work with Exchange Server? How is this going to attract the executive Treo users who can afford to carry this status symbol?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that you usually buy your phone from your network provider? When's the last time you bought a computer from your ISP?</p>
<p>Have you noticed the missing feature on iPhone's maps? You have to enter a city name to do a search. Can't it tell where you are based on the towers it's connecting to?</p>
<p>With all of the entrenched economics and politics, phones just don't work the way they should. They are just weird.</p>

<p>If you're new to the show, then welcome. If not, then you probably know that I am a Java programmer by day, and .NET by night. So it may come as a surprise to you that I have purchased a Mac. I got a 15 inch MacBook Pro. The "entry-level" version with a 2.2 GHz processor, not the 2.4. And certainly not the 17 inch boat that frankly should come with a set of trucks so you can ollie and rail slide your way to work.</p>
<p>If you are not new to the show, then you probably know that I am passionate about quality. I'm on a constant quest for quality in my own software and in the software that I use. I've heard it said that people who love software want to build their own hardware, but I didn't really understand that until I used my new Mac. This thing was built to run quality software.</p>
<p>For one thing, you have the specs. This, like I said, is a 2.2 GHz laptop. It comes with 2 Gig of memory and a 5400 RPM hard drive standard. You can't choose anything less and still have a MacBook Pro. Apple just won't let you. Other manufacturers sell similar specs for the money, but their stuff appears less expensive because you can buy less machine.</p>
<p>For another thing, you have the screen. This 15.4 inch monitor has a 1440x900 resolution. That's the same as the 22 inch panel on my desktop. Do the math ... the not new among you know that I love to do the math ... and you see that this screen is twice as dense! Apple won't let you see a pixely picture. There's a reason that Safari looks bad on Windows ... it was designed for a Mac!</p>
<p>So this is hardware worthy of quality software. It begs for quality software. In fact, if you write crappy software for the Mac, nobody will use it. The Apple community has come to expect a certain level of polish on their apps. Sure, some of them only go skin deep, but at least the effort is visible. I use an open-source instant messenger called Adium, and even this little app has the clean simple look of OS X. It even has a gorgeous little green duck icon that looks great sitting in the dock next to the Garage Band guitar. I'm a Java developer, so I know. You're lucky if we replace the coffee cup. And when I'm writing a Windows app, 16 colors and a copy of Paint is good enough.</p>
<p>But you know that I can't live without my .NET. Having written in C#, I never want to go back to C++. The Mono Project isn't keeping up, so I, of course, installed Boot Camp and Vista on this baby. And let me tell you, it runs Vista like a dream. I can't imagine the heat that the Boot Camp team gets in Cupertino for writing Windows drivers, but they did an excellent job.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's not my intent to become a Mac bigot or to convince you to switch. I just know quality when I see it, and the not new know that I'm all about the user experience.</p>
<p>My name is Michael L Perry, and I run Windows on the Mac.</p>

<p><a atomicselection="true" href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/subclipse-problem-occurred.png"><img border="0" width="532" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/subclipse-problem-occurred-thumb.png" alt="Problem Occurred: cannot checkout" height="188" style="border: 0px" /></a></p>
<p>I have just tried to import a Team Project Set into Eclipse from an SVN repository using the Subclipse plugin. Checking the Console window in Eclipse, I see that the problem was an obstructed update. I already had a project directory by that name. I need to delete it first.</p>
<p>So the plugin already knew what the problem was. After all, it put the error message in a different window. It could have at least displayed it in the popup.</p>
<p>In this situation, there are two correct actions for the software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the problem itself (after prompting, since this would be a destructive fix), or</li>
<li>Tell me how to fix the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the only correct options, but at least displaying the error message would be a start.</p>
<p>Eclipse's plugin architecture may be to blame for this one. It is difficult to get different components to work together, especially if they were written by entirely different teams and integrated only on the user's desktop. Perhaps there was no easy way for the plugin to give its host enough information. Composite applications often turn into Frankenstein's Monsters. But Eclipse is usually better integrated than this.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/ais/AiS29.mp3">Listen Now</a></p>
<p>Several recent events are converging on a common theme.</p>
<p>Windows Presentation Foundation brings new user interface possibilities to Vista. Silverlight delivers WPF to the browser. Microsoft’s surface computer let’s us interact with the computer on a near-tactile level. Steve Jobs announced that the programming model for the iPhone is Ajax in Safari. Apple ported Safari to Windows. And Google Gears allows you to run a web application while not on the web.</p>
<p>All of these events demonstrate that the new programming model is markup and script. This has been the programming model for Web 2.0, but it is now it is breaking out of the browser.</p>
<p>This programming model has some promise, but there is a dark side. This moves us away from computer science based in proof. The tools that we have chosen to use for the new programming model are usually dynamically typed. With the exception of C# in WPF, the scripting languages that we bolt on to the markup are neither compiled nor statically typed.</p>
<p>Static typing is not just a way to give us intellisense, but it is a way to express intent in the form of a contact. Type checking is one simple way for the compiler to check a contract. But wouldn’t it be great if the compiler could do even more for us? Current research languages can prove that null pointers are not derefferenced. And with existing theorem provers, it is feasible to verify preconditions and post conditions at compile time. Despite the apparent evidence to the contrary, the web model is leading away from a path of increased productivity.</p>
<p>In addition, the web model does not support real-time collaboration. The best we can achieve with a request/response protocol like HTTP is rapid refresh. That solution is not scalable, and not feasible for many kinds of highly collaborative applications. And even when it works, the programming model forces developers to be aware of the fact that they are checking for updates. They can’t just express the relationships among objects and leave it at that.</p>
<p>I see a new programming model on the horizon after the markup/script wave has passed. In this programming model, the code represents the relationships between objects, not the triggers that cause the next domino to fall in a Rube Goldberg machine made of script. The compiler and the runtime can work together to make inter-related objects behave in a provably consistent way.</p>
<p>Update Controls is the first step along this path. With this library, you express the relationships between your user interface components and your data. You say what is to be displayed; the runtime takes care of when. If the data is changed in one window, the library pushes that change to the others automatically.</p>
<p>The next step is a collaborative object model that pushes those changes across the wire. When that step is ready, data can be changed on one computer, and the effect will automatically appear on another. Best of all, application developers won’t need to code that behavior. They simply express the relationships among objects and the runtime makes it happen.</p>
<p>I hope you will be with me for the next few steps in our evolution. The future is rapidly approaching in which we bring great value to our clients. It’s closer than you think.</p>

<p>My wife is a scrapbook consultant. She was looking for a way to showcase her artwork on her web page. Instead of your typical list of thumbnails, I thought it would be more interesting to put her scrapbook pages in iTunes cover flow. So after a weekend of messing with javascript, this is the result:</p>
<p><a href="http://myscraproom.net/pageflow.html">http://myscraproom.net/pageflow.html</a></p>
<p>It doesn't have the oblique angles, but I think I know how to achieve that effect. There is also a Safari compatibility issue, and a performance improvement I can make. More to come.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
Finn Rudolph has added many enhancements to the original script. I highly recommend using his <a href="http://imageflow.finnrudolph.de/">Image Flow</a>.</p>

					<p>I am pleased to announce the release of a new product line and web site. <a href="http://updatecontrols.net/">Update Controls .NET</a> is a suite of Windows Forms controls that automatically update themselves. A short demonstration loop is up on the main page right now, and more detailed videos will be posted within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In traditional Windows Forms programming, you have to set properties on the controls in order to populate them with data. When the data changes, you have to set those properties again. Usually, you will end up writing one method that sets all of the control properties whether they need it or not, and call that method anytime something happens.</p>
<p>With Update Controls, you don't set properties. Instead, you handle events that get and set the data. For example, the UpdateTextBox control fires GetText whenever its text is out-of-date. You handle that event and return the text that it should display. When the underlying data changes, the control fired the event again.</p>
<p>It may seem like magic, but it's really quite simple. You put Dynamic sentries in your data objects that keep track of each time your properties are accessed. Whenever a property is accessed during the course of a GetText event, that control's text is linked to that property. When the property changes, the control is out-of-date.</p>
<p>Go download the library and try it for yourself. Most people who have tried it can't bring themselves to write Windows Forms without it.</p>

					<p>I use iTunes to subscribe to and sync my podcasts. I organize my podcasts in a playlist so that I can listen to them on my daily commute. This works very well in the car, as I don't have to take my attention from the road to find the next episode to play. However, the experience at the computer is not as good as it could be.</p>
<p>The Podcast section of iTunes contains a list of all my subscriptions. I start iTunes every morning, flip to the Podcast section, and hit the "Refresh" button. (Why iTunes doesn't install as a service and download my shows while I'm sleeping is a question for another post.) First it checks all of my subscriptions for new episodes. As it finds them, it displays the episode name and queues up the download. Before the download completes, the episode name is grayed out.</p>
<p>My goal is to choose the shows I want to listen to that day and drop them into the playlist in my chosen order. However, I can't do that until the download completes. So instead I have to leave the computer, eat breakfast, and return only after all the queued shows have (hopefully) downloaded. It would be much better to get it all done at once.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong><br />
An iTunes playlist is not a collection of content. It is a collection of references -- identities. iTunes already knows the identity of the podcast episode before it downloads. It can display the name, it can request the content from the remote server, and it can track the download status. All of these things require that it has a concept of identity for the show. It should be possible to drag an episode to the playlist before it finishes downloading.</p>
<p>iTunes has recently added a page that displays the download queue. This is a fantastic feature. But again, you cannot drag a podcast from this view into a playlist, even though this view is little more than a list of identities.</p>
<p>Fellow programmers, how can we learn from this oversight? When designing our applications we should be aware of the difference between an object and its identity. If we are loading a list from the database to display to the user, it is necessary to load all of the content, or is the identity sufficient? If we are attaching a document to a message, do we really need to copy the entire file or can we just include a universal path? Identity awareness is one of those little things that leads to a better user experience.</p>

					<p>Just a quick note to Steve Jobs and all the talented people at Apple. Thank you for fixing my iPod.</p>
<p>I have a fifth generation, and I just recently upgraded the firmware. Yes, I'm slow to adopt new versions of software. And iTunes 7 has not had a spotless reputation, so I was particularly reluctant to upgrade. But now that I have, I couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>iTunes 7 adds a few features that really amount to little more than iCandy. But even so, that sugar tastes pretty good. In particular, I love cover flow. It acknowledges my conceptual model of music by displaying the artwork of all my albums. Sure, we all know that digital music is stored in files, not on circular disks in square covers, but we still think in the album-oriented metaphor. It's good of Apple to give a nod to a music-lover's way of thinking.</p>
<p>But it's the firmware upgrade for my iPod that really has me singing Steve's praise. With absolutely no work on my part, Apple has restored the continuous experience of listening to my Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa albums. The tiny quarter-second gap that it used to put between consecutive tracks is finally gone. I had previously edited together all 21 tracks of They Might Be Giants' "Fingertips" because the fractional pause every twenty seconds was driving me crazy. This is a fix long overdue.</p>
<p>The iTunes 7 experience is not completely without flaws, however. As I mentioned on Episode 4 of the Adventures in Software talk show, cover flow highlights an identity problem with the file-oriented implementation model. Since albums don't have identity, iTunes sometimes gets confused and displays multiple copies of the same album art. Perhaps a fix in iTunes 7.1?</p>

				<small>Monday, December 4th, 2006</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My wife runs a scrapbooking business (<a href="http://myscraproom.net/">http://myscraproom.net</a>). She uses the Internet to keep in touch with her customers. Yesterday she started using Constant Contact (<a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/">http://www.constantcontact.com</a>), a service that sends out beautifully presented form letters to her email subscribers (opt-in only; they don't believe in spam). She was very happy with the newsletter editing and management capabilities of this service. But when it came time to import her distribution list, she got quite upset.</p>
<p>The service has a feature to import distribution lists via CSV or Excel. Her distribution list is in Outlook 2000. You would think that moving that distribution list over would be a supported use-case. However, niether Outlook nor Constant Contact made this easy.</p>
<p>At first, I showed her how to export contacts to CSV. We walked through the export wizard until it got to the screen where you chose your contact folder. The My Scrap Room distribution list did not appear as an option. The screen lists only folders, not distribution lists.</p>
<p>So I suggested she export all of her contacts to CSV and sort them out at the site. She did that, uploaded the CSV to the site, and was presented with a long ugly screen that asked her to individually format each contact. There was no option on this screen to select which ones to import and which to ignore.</p>
<p>So my next suggestion was that we edit the CSV file before uploading. I won't describe how upset she got when we opened the CSV in notepad and she saw the jumbled mess that I was asking her to sift through. Trying the same thing in Excel only provided a slightly better presentation of the same junk.</p>
<p>She has since entered her distribution list by hand, cursing the state of software the whole time. This was particularly embarrasing to me, since I am constantly telling her (and everybody else) how much better it could be. You would think that Constant Contact would consider importing an Outlook distribution list to be a primary use-case. They imply that it is when they claim to "easily import permission-based email lists from your contact management software, MS Outlook® or spreadsheet". In practice, though, their support for Outlook is limited to CSV.</p>
<p>Microsoft, of course, has their share of the blame. There is no way in Outlook 2000 to export a distribution list to CSV. I don't know if this has been added in later versions, as I tend to keep my wife's machine on a very slow upgrade cycle. But even at the time that Outlook 2000 was developed, this should have been an obvious feature.</p>
<p>The bulk of the blame, however, goes to browser-based services in general. When a browser is between your service and your customers, you cannot integrate with their data and applications. A rich client could have easily used the Outlook API to extract email addresses without going through the export/import mess. The Web has brought us an amazing array of services, but has also set the state of user interaction back 15 years. Even now, Web 2.0 is struggling to catch back up to what is trivial on the desktop. Sure, the browser is fine for less intimate contact, like buying a book, but software that helps you run your business deserves a rich client.</p>
