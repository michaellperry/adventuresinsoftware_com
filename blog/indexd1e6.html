		<description>I figured out that you were interested into dependencies analysis and I wanted to let you know about our tool NDepend.
http://www.NDepend.com

NDepend analyses source code and .NET assemblies. It allows controlling the complexity, the internal dependencies and the quality of .NET code. 

NDepend provides a language (CQL Code Query Language) dedicated to query and constraint a codebase. 

It also comes from with advanced code visualization (Dependencies Matrix, Metric treemap, Box and Arrows graph...), more than 60 metrics, facilities to generate reports and to be integrated with mainstream build technologies and development tools. 

NDepend also allows to compare precisely different versions of your codebase.</description>
