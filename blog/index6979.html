				<small>January 17th, 2008 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="indexb7c7.html?p=177">Historic modeling</a> is the technique of representing a solution as a history of discrete events. This differs from static modeling, which represents the solution as a snapshot. The static model is concerned with the state of the system, whereas the historic model is more concerned with how it got there.</p>
<p>A historic model can be represented in an Entity Fact diagram. This is analogous to the Entity Relationship diagram used in static models. The difference is that you represent historic facts instead of static relationships. Relationships can change over time, but facts are always true.</p>
<p><strong>Automotive Wireless</strong><br />
I am currently working on an automotive wireless system that provides an excellent example of an Entity Fact diagram. This system tracks wireless devices such as OnStar modules that are installed in vehicles. The entities in this domain are things like the phone number (MDN/MIN), the wireless unit, the vehicle, the customer, and the service. We can draw an ERD to represent the relationships among these entities.</p>
<p><a href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/auto_erd.png"><img src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/auto-erd-thumb.png" style="border-width: 0px" alt="auto_erd" border="0" height="77" width="503" /></a></p>
<p>In this ERD, we represent entities as rectangles, relationships as diamonds, and properties as ellipses. We are particularly concerned with the status of a wireless account (active, suspended, inactive, etc.) and the status of a wireless device (scrap, replacement, defective, etc.) The account status is a property of the relationship between phone number and device.</p>
<p>In this ERD, relationships can come and go. A unit can be removed from a vehicle and a replacement installed. A customer can enroll in a service, and later cancel their subscription. In a typical static model, these relationships are created and destroyed to represent the current state.</p>
<p><strong>Expand to an EFD</strong><br />
To model the system historically, we make note of all the events that could occur. Each of these events is one fact: it occurred at some point in time. Whether the effect of that event is still present is less important. The fact is, and always will be, that it happened.</p>
<p>The facts in this system are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An MDN/MIN was paired with a unit.</li>
<li>The MDN/MIN pairing was removed (the account was closed).</li>
<li>A customer took delivery of a vehicle.</li>
<li>A customer enrolled in a service for a vehicle.</li>
<li>A service enrollment was canceled.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many others as well. Here is the complete diagram.</p>
<p><a href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/auto_efd.png"><img src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/auto-efd-thumb.png" style="border-width: 0px" alt="auto_efd" border="0" height="180" width="491" /></a></p>
<p>You'll notice that these facts usually relate two or more entities. In fact, they usually create or destroy relationships between those entities. When one fact modifies the effect of another fact, it references the original. So, for example, an Unpairing destroys the relationship established by a Pairing.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />
A fact cannot exist until its referenced entities exist. An MDN/MIN must be assigned by the phone company before it can be paired with the MEID of a device. Both the vehicle and the customer must exist before the customer can take delivery of the vehicle.</p>
<p>This prerequisite relationship is also true for facts. An MDN/MIN pairing must occur before they can be unpaired. A customer must take delivery of a vehicle before enrolling in services for that vehicle. So the arrows not only indicate references, but also define a partial order. The referenced fact must occur before the referencing fact.</p>
<p><strong>Atomicity</strong><br />
Facts are either true or not. The event has either occurred or it hasn't. There is no intermediate state.</p>
<p>Notice the history formed by Manufacture and Replacement. A vehicle is manufactured with one unit. At some time later, that unit is replaced with another unit. The replacement destroys the vehicle-unit relationship created by the manufacture, and <strong>simultaneously creates another relationship</strong>. That replacement unit can later be replaced by yet another replacement unit, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>The source of truth</strong><br />
This ERD is color coded to indicate the source of each of these facts. Blue facts come from the phone company, green from the device supplier, and red from the auto manufacturer. This helps us see interactions between various parties. We can see, for example, that the device supplier can't tell us that a pairing will not be used until the phone company tells us that it exists. This helps us see that we have to wait for the phone company to tell us that the number is paired before we send an unpairing request, thus avoiding a race condition.</p>
<p>Whether the program is written historically, an Entity Fact Diagram can help us capture important information. It is more complete than the ERD alone, as it shows all the ways in which relationships can come and go. It helps us communicate the order in which events can occur, and gives us guidance on transaction scope and system interactions.</p>

				<small>January 15th, 2008 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

					<p>I don't know why, but elevators fascinate me. I guess it's because they represent a daily junction of people, process, and technology. They embody many of the problems we face with limited resources, queues, and traffic.</p>
<p>I've noticed that people tend to gather in front of doors that are about to open. It's probably preservation of your place in line so that the elevator doesn't fill up with people who haven't been waiting as long as you have.</p>
<p>The problem with this behavior is that the elevator is invariably filled with people wanting to get off. There is always a dance where the people trying to get out negotiate with the people trying to get in for a traffic lane. The dance lasts for about three seconds and it always ends with the people crowding around the doors retreating into the lobby to give the others a lane of egress.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better for everyone if people would stand away from the doors? You can be fairly certain, especially on the ground floor, that there are people trying to get off the elevator. There is limited space inside the car, but comparatively unlimited space in the lobby. It only makes sense to let them off first.</p>
<p>But people don't behave that way. The elevator represents a limited resource that they have already invested in. They have to preserve their access to that resource.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong>    <br />Put the alert light and bell on a delay. Instead of alerting the people waiting for the elevator before the doors open, only give the indication after the people in the car have had the chance to get out.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with software?</p>
<p>Well, besides the trivial observation that modern elevators are run by software, this is an example of user interaction design. It recognizes human behavior and uses it to solve the problem. You might even call it a life hack.</p>
<p>So many software systems fight against human behavior. They put up punitive error messages to try to get the human to change their ways, or force the user through some complicated dance of gesticulations in order to get a simple task accomplished. But well-designed software recognizes the human as part of the system, and incorporates their behavior as-is into the solution.</p>

				<h2><a href="index146c.html?p=186" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Requirements Gathering, Columbo Style">Requirements Gathering, Columbo Style</a></h2>
				<small>January 10th, 2008 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Sometimes you have to act like you don't understand.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo"><img style="padding-right: 3px; padding-left: 3px; padding-bottom: 3px; padding-top: 3px" src="../../upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Columbo.jpg/200px-Columbo.html" align="right" /></a> My friend and former colleague from Radiant John Howison is a master of this technique. Having just seen <a href="http://www.tv.com/columbo/agenda-for-murder/episode/101408/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;51">Columbo: Agenda for Murder</a>, I thought I would give it a try.</p>
<p>I just started a new engagement. My role on this project is not coder, not architect, but analyst. It is my job to document the requirements such that they are useful to the technical team. It is my job to ask questions.</p>
<p>Columbo was a fictional police detective who gathered information not by intimidation, and not by brilliant displays of intellect, but by acting like he didn't understand. He could always get people to give him information that they might otherwise withhold or ignore. Since that's my job on this engagement, I'm trying the same technique.</p>
<p><strong>Admit that you are not the domain expert</strong>     <br />In Agenda for Murder, Columbo put a secretary at ease by telling her that he didn't know how to use a fax machine or office telephone. Not only did he tell her, but his questions showed that he was no expert. He let her see that she had expertise that he himself didn't have. Once she was in that position, she slowed down and explained every detail of their operation. The key to solving the mystery might have been in those details.</p>
<p>Had he tried to show off his intellect and be superior to the secretary, she might have been less willing to talk to him. She might have just glossed over the details, since the Lieutenant must already know them. And so he might have missed some valuable information.</p>
<p>I've admitted to my client that he is the domain expert, not me. I've asked some stupid questions that proved that point. I didn't deliberately set out to ask stupid questions, but neither did I refrain from asking in case they <em>were</em> stupid. I'm not in an intelligence competition with my client, so I don't mind looking like I don't know something. It just encourages him to slow down and explain every detail.</p>
<p><strong>Don't let an assumption go unchallenged</strong>     <br />The premise of the show was that the murderer went to great pains to make the deed look like a suicide. Walking in on this scene, most people would make the assumption that it was, in fact, a suicide. That assumption would blind them to facts that say otherwise. People tend to bend facts to match their preconceived assumptions.</p>
<p>But Columbo did not allow this assumption to stand. As he walked into the crime scene, a fellow officer was relating the details that they discovered so far. In his tone and language, he indicated that it was a suicide. Columbo corrected him, taking away the veil of the assumption. With this new vision, he was able to spot quickly the evidence that indicated murder.</p>
<p>Walking into this engagement, I took stock of the assumptions I was making about the problem domain. Every fact that I use had to be backed up by a conversation of document that I exchanged with the client. If not, I document that assumption. Twice a day, I go through this list in person with the client. Usually my assumptions are correct, but we've already caught some rather large and dangerous misunderstandings this way.</p>
<p>But sometimes the assumption is the client's. It's difficult when talking to just one person to differentiate fact from assumption. Talking to more than one person and walking through scenarios verbally can help.</p>
<p><strong>Ask the same question of multiple people</strong>     <br />Columbo asked the suspect for details about the night of the murder. He then asked his alibi for the same details. There were, of course, slight discrepancies. These details may or may not have been important, but there was no way to know.</p>
<p>Columbo, of course, is trying to catch someone in a lie. I'm not expecting my clients to be deliberately withholding information from me, but each person has their own perspective on the project. Each person has their own goals, and their own experiences. These color the facts that they give me. By asking, I'm not looking for <em>the</em> answer, just <em>their</em> answer.</p>
<p><strong>Walk through everything out loud</strong>     <br />In the show, Columbo verbally walked through the suspect's description of events on the night of the murder. The suspect described how he received a phone call from the victim, how he sounded desperate, and how he declined to help. Columbo rewound the conversation and restated the &quot;facts&quot;. He asked what was said that sounded so desperate. With this walkthrough, the suspect told him that the victim said &quot;What am I going to do&quot; twice and hung up. This is a detail that was not revealed in the first telling.</p>
<p>Later the suspect tells Columbo that he received a second call that night. Columbo reminds him that his wife only heard the phone ring once, so he claims that the call came in on call waiting. The fact that the victim hung up puts the lie to the suspects claims. But without walking through the scenario to extract details and establish timing, Columbo wouldn't have had this information.</p>
<p>I've verbally walked through the process with my client several times now. He provided use cases, which is a fantastic starting point, but they are no substitute for a live, personal, verbal walkthrough. Each time we go through it, I learn something new. Sometimes it's a detail in the use case that I missed. Other times, it's new information that I then add.</p>
<p>It's easier to act smart than to act dumb. Instead of posturing, I have to check my ego and realize that my client is smarter than me. And so far it seems to be effective. Although I have yet to produce any significant documentation, my client tells me I'm asking good questions.</p>

					<p>Why don't elevator panels have a really big button for the first floor?</p>
<p><a href="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/elevator1.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="244" alt="elevator" src="../../www.adventuresinsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/elevator-thumb1.jpg" width="205" align="right" border="0" /></a>Most people ride the elevator up to a particular floor, conduct their business, and then ride it back down to the first floor. Rarely does anyone need to ride between two upper floors. So by inference, half of the time you step into an elevator you have to push the "1" button.</p>
<p>Making the ground floor button more convenient will certainly make the others less so. But not all of the buttons are equal. The minor increase in effort spent looking for an upper floor button is far outweighed by the decrease in effort on the way back down.</p>
<p>When we design software, we usually think in terms of functionality. We want to cram in everything that the user might want, and account for every possible situation. Instead, we should focus on the things that the user does most often and make them the most convenient. It's not the feature matrix that sells software, it's the big red button that gets you where you want to go.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>While <a href="index0325.html?p=174">giving a presentation</a> at the Dallas .NET User's Group, I gave the audience something to snicker about. I run Vista on a MacBook Pro. So everyone had a good laugh at my expense when I couldn't get the projector working.</p>
<p>I had used a projector from my laptop before, so I was quite confused when the Windows Mobility Center insisted that there was no display connected. I kept hitting the &quot;Connect display&quot; button, it would say &quot;Detecting...&quot; and then switch back to &quot;No display connected&quot;. I eventually borrowed someone's Dell laptop, after converting my Power Point 2007 presentation to 2003.</p>
<p>The information I found on line led me to update Boot Camp, and to replace the display driver from Apple with the one from NVidia. Though it apparently worked for some, it didn't make a difference for me.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong>    <br />I eventually found that the external display worked if it was connected during power-up. If you plug in the projector before you boot, all is well. And if you are already booted up, just hibernate, plug in, and resume. If you get up to the podium and things aren't working, close the lid, wait for the front light to start snoring, then open it again.</p>
<p>Give this a try before your presentation and see if it works for you. And always keep your presentation on a USB thumb drive in the 2003 compatible format just in case.</p>

Notice the difference between the advertisements for the iPhone and every other phone on the market. Other phones show people talking on the phone, snapping pictures of each other, dancing around, getting into kung fu battles with phones as weapons, everything except what the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/">iPhone ads</a> show you: <i>how you use the phone</i>. Think about that. They sell the iPhone by showing you thirty seconds of someone using it, assuming that this will make people want it &#8230; which it does, because people recognize that using a product with good interaction design feels good.</p>

<p>If we intend to sell our software to the masses, we need to adopt the iPhone marketing model. Whether or not you agree, most people find the iPhone ads desirable. My friend's 5-year-old son will come running into the room to watch a commercial when he hears the distinctive iPhone music. I will stop my TiVo to watch an iPhone or iPod Touch ad. And I own an iPod Touch! The interface is so pleasurable that we want to watch people use it.</p>
<p>But even companies that don't have the money to run TV spots should aspire to the standard that Apple has set. Software sells by word-of-mouth. Every time a user fires up your software, they should be seeing an ad.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about ad-supported software. I'm talking about the user having such a great experience that they want to tell people about it. I'm talking about a user interface so fun that people want to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKQUZPqDZb0">watch it on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The iPhone is sorely lacking in features. The iPod Touch has extremely limited capacity for the price and crashes fairly often. But the icons fly in when you hit the home button. And the album cover flips and rotates when you turn it. These are the things that you see in the commercials. These things are fun. These are the things that sell.</p>

				<h2><a href="indexb50d.html?p=178" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Behavior vs State">Behavior vs State</a></h2>
				<small>December 11th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>When discussing topics such as definitiveness or dependency, I'll use the word &quot;behavior&quot; when others might say &quot;state&quot;. The difference might seem academic, but it has some practical ramifications that become apparent later.</p>
<p>The behavior of an object is what you can observe. It can be measured using the object's public interface alone. The interface is a contract that constrains an object's behavior, and that contract doesn't allow you to see anything else. This is the object-oriented concept of information hiding.</p>
<p>The state of an object is what it contains. You need to pierce the public interface or use a debugger to observe an object's state. A loose contract (a.k.a. a &quot;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky abstraction</a>&quot;) might let some of that state show through. The object uses its own state to implement its behavior. This is the object-oriented concept of encapsulation.</p>
<p>So the behavior of an object is implemented in terms of state. But behavior can be described without invoking state at all. I can say that the behavior of a business object is dependent upon the behavior of a row in a database. There may be caching going on, and that cache may have state that can change. But that doesn't make it dynamic. A properly implemented cache is still dependent, because it behaves that way.</p>
<p>When considering the public interface of an object, behavior is all that matters. So when I want to say something about an object and its interaction with other objects, I'll limit myself to talking about behavior. I'll ignore state until it's time to code.</p>
<p><strong>The behavior of numbers</strong>    <br />Consider the number 3. I can represent this number in any of a number of ways. I can draw three vertical lines. I can hold up three fingers. I can draw the numeral 3. Or I can store the bits 00000011. These are different states that represent the object 3, depending upon its implementation.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have defined integers based entirely on their behavior. They say that there exists an integer called zero. They also say that if you increment or decrement any integer, you will get another integer. This is a sufficient definition, and it has nothing to do with representation.</p>
<p>So you can define the number 3 as the integer that you get when you increment zero, increment the result, and increment again. It doesn't matter how you store the state &quot;3&quot;, a correct implementation will exhibit this behavior.</p>
<p>If we use vertical lines, you increment by drawing one more. If we use fingers, you hold up one more. If we use binary, you flip bits from left to right, stopping at the first zero-to-one transition. These are all implementation details based on state. But the behavior is always the same.</p>
<p><strong>The effect of describing behavior</strong>    <br />If I limit myself to talking about behavior, then I get to do a few good things. First, I get to say what I mean without a bunch of qualifications. I can say that the business object depends upon the database row without having to describe the cache that sits in between. I can say that history grows indefinitely, even though a program that actually did that would eventually crash.</p>
<p>Second, I get to procrastinate. I can put decisions off until I have enough information to make them. I can implement an object's behavior one way, then measure the system to see if I need to change it.</p>
<p>Third, I get to prove things. There is a reason that mathematicians define integers based on behavior. It's hard to prove things about state. Formal proofs of algorithms is notoriously difficult. But proofs based on behavior are trivial by comparison.</p>
<p>When I explore some techniques for historic modeling in upcoming posts, I'll be talking about the behavior of objects. When getting down to the implementation details, I'll start talking about state. It's the difference between the two that makes these techniques so useful.</p>

				<h2><a href="indexb7c7.html?p=177" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Historic Modeling">Historic Modeling</a></h2>
				<small>December 5th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There is one pattern for using definitive behavior that I failed to mention in the <a href="indexa09e.html?p=175">previous post</a>. This is perhaps the most important of them all, so it deserves special treatment.</p>
<p>Historic modeling is quite simply storing a history of actions, not the current state of a system. The current state is mutable, whereas history is fixed. Once something has been done, it cannot be undone, and it cannot be changed. A history is an ever growing log of permanent records.</p>
<p>One example of historic modeling from the real world is a chess game. The position of the board changes regularly during the course of a game. The position is dynamic. Yet the record of moves does not change. Once a move is made, it cannot be taken back or changed.</p>
<p>Another example is a checkbook register. The current balance can change over time, but the history of checks, once written, never changes.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of historic modeling</strong>    <br />History is sufficient. Given a history of a system, it is trivial to go back to any point in time to construct it's state. If you have a record of chess moves, you just make each move in turn to produce the board position at every point in the game. If you have a ledger of checks, you can just add up the amounts including the opening balance up to a certain point in time. The current state doesn't contain enough information to reconstruct the history, but the history is sufficient to reconstruct the current state.</p>
<p>History is atomic. Each action in the history has happened. Actions not yet in the history have not. There is no middle ground. This is why <a href="index2c90.html?p=120">banks keep ledgers of account transfers</a>, rather than trying to decrement one account balance and increment another. Balance, being state, is not atomic.</p>
<p>History is consistent. Two people comparing notes can easily disagree on the current state of a system. To come to an agreement, they must compare histories. That's why the bank sends you a list of transactions at the end of each month, rather than just your account balance. That's the only way to reconcile your version of the truth with your bank's. Eventually, all parties will come to agree on the same version of history.</p>
<p>History is transparent. Logging and auditing systems exist to help us trace anomalies to their source. Without them, all we could do is look at the current state and wonder if it is correct. It is relatively easy to hide money in a series of accounts; but if you must produce an accurate history of transactions, each one can be called into question.</p>
<p><strong>History as definitive behavior</strong>    <br />So what does historic modeling have to do with definitive behavior? After all, history is always growing, while definitive behavior is something that doesn't change during the life of an object.</p>
<p>While the history of a given system changes, each event in history is constant. Once it is added to history, it cannot be changed. The behavior of the event is definitive, even if the history of events is dynamic.</p>
<p>The effect of an event might change over time. For example, you might think you have enough in your account to write that check, only to learn later that your spouse made a withdrawal beforehand. In your original history, that check left a positive balance in the account. But after learning about other events, you discover that the check left you overdrawn. Still, that doesn't change the fact that the check was written for a certain amount.</p>
<p><strong>History in practice</strong>    <br />By the above discussion, a historic model is a database that allows inserts, but no updates or deletes. Every time you need to make a change, you insert the appropriate type of record. To determine the current state of the system, you need to query the aggregate of history.</p>
<p>This is obviously impractical. Such a database would grow without bounds. The aggregate queries would get slower over time and eventually make the system unusable. We need one more observation to make it all work.</p>
<p>A system is historic if it appears to be so, whether it actually works as advertised. This observation allows for optimizations like caching, archiving, and pruning. As long as there is some level of abstraction at which you cannot see that the optimization is taking place (without using a stopwatch), then you can still claim to have a historic model. Future posts will discuss these optimizations in detail.</p>

				<h2><a href="index3440.html?p=176" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Right Time to Update">The Right Time to Update</a></h2>
				<small>November 26th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I use subversion for all of my personal and professional source code control. As I've stated before, I highly recommend that you <a href="index5eda.html?p=95">set up an SVN repository</a> for managing and sharing your own projects. My client of choice is <a href="http://syncrosvnclient.com/">Syncro SVN</a>. But like all the other SVN clients that I've tried, it picks the wrong time to update.</p>
<p>When drilling down through the folders of a repository, all SVN clients pause each time a folder is opened to fetch data from the server. Syncro SVN keeps the tree populated while the program is running, so you can collapse and expand folders without penalty. However, once you close the program, it has to fetch folder contents all over again the next time you run it.</p>
<p>This pause for every folder puts a small tax on user navigation. It puts a speed bump on the road that the user takes to get something done. I hold in my head the place that I need to go and the thing that I need to do once I get there. A series of speed bumps, like the so-called &quot;Chinese&quot; water torture, can distract me from that goal and derail my progress.</p>
<p>An even more common example of the wrong time to update can be found in just about any program that downloads new versions of itself. Every once in a while, I start Firefox, Quicken, or iTunes to be asked if I want to install an update. The reason that I started this program was not to install an update. It was to get something accomplished. This question completely puts me off my goal and makes me worry. Is there some serious bug or security problem that I should let them fix? How long will this update take? What's the chance that it will fail and prevent me from accomplishing my goal altogether?</p>
<p>All of these programs let me say no, which I do by default. But then in most cases I'm just asked the question again the next time I try to get something done, so I eventually relent. Firefox is the best of a bad bunch, because it will hold off the update until the end of my session. Of course, it still has to ask, and then it has to tell me that it will update itself. I'd rather it just do that by default.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my solution</strong>    <br />I recently implemented automatic self update in a Windows program. I fashioned it after the Firefox model, but just made it work without any pop-ups.</p>
<p>First I created a launcher for the program. This launcher just runs the program, after doing some bookkeeping that I'll describe soon.</p>
<p>Then, when the program starts, it starts a background thread to go to the web site and check for newer versions. If it finds one, it downloads it in the background. If the user closes the program before the download completes, it is canceled. It will try again the next time the program starts.</p>
<p>If the download succeeds, then the new version is put in a sub folder for the launcher to find. This is the bookkeeping I was talking about. The next time the user runs the program, the launcher quickly (and silently) installs the new version before running it.</p>
<p><strong>Update data in the background</strong>    <br />The right time to update is when the user isn't looking. This works equally well for data updates as it does for software updates. Syncro SVN could start a background thread to pull down folder contents. This would get that processing off the main thread, and keep the user from experiencing a series of speed bumps.</p>
<p>But background processing isn't enough. If the background process is fired on demand, then the user is still waiting before going to the next step. You also need persistence. Once the folder contents are on the client, they should be accessible no matter what happens. If the user restarts the program, they should still be able to get instant access to folders that they've visited before. That means that those contents should be cached in someplace other than memory.</p>
<p>But wait! The user isn't seeing an up-to-date picture of the data! That's OK. It's fresh enough for the user to move forward toward his goal. Just refresh the data (in the background) when it gets too old. And give the user a manual refresh button if they don't see what they are looking for. Your user is smart. Just keep the speed bumps out of his way.</p>

				<h2><a href="indexa09e.html?p=175" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Definitive behavior patterns">Definitive behavior patterns</a></h2>
				<small>November 19th, 2007 <!-- by Michael L Perry --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In a <a href="indexa828.html?p=171">previous post</a>, I described definitive behavior as something that doesn't change during the life of the object. This describes what definitive behavior is, but not how you would use it. Some of the ways to use definitive behavior are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immutable data types</li>
<li>Extenders</li>
<li>Views</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immutable data types</strong>    <br />Objects in any OO language have properties that can change (dynamic behavior). When you can create an object and pass it into a method, that method can modify the state of the object. The caller might experience different behavior from the object after the method call than before. This is usually desirable, but sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>When it comes to fundamental data types, you don't want dynamic behavior. You don't want the method that you call to change your string or integer variables. In Java, C#, and VB (among others), these data types are immutable.</p>
<p>When you define your own data type, consider whether it will be used as a fundamental value. A complex number, for example, falls into this category. When you add two complex numbers, you want to return a new instance which holds the sum of their real and imaginary parts, respectively. You don't want to modify one of the addends, you want to return the sum.</p>
<p>The alternative to a value is an object with identity. Any number 3 is just the same as any other number 3. They are indistinguishable. But objects that have identity are unique, regardless of any defining characteristic.</p>
<p>Consider a person. You might define a PersonName class that has a first, middle, and last name. You might then define a Person class that has a PersonName property. A Person has identity irrespective of name. Two entirely different people can have the same name. And a person can change his or her name, but that does not change their identity. So while the PersonName class should be immutable, the Person class can change its name by creating a whole new instance of PersonName.</p>
<p><strong>Extenders</strong>    <br />How do you add properties to an existing object? One way is to declare a derived class, but then you have to create the object as an instance of that derived class. What if someone else has created the object, and they know nothing of your class?</p>
<p>A great way to do this is to define an extender class. This adds properties to an existing class through aggregation, not inheritance. The extender references the existing object and defines additional properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2001/jw-0817-automatic.html">One example</a> that I created long ago is a location model that extends network objects with their locations on a diagram. Routers, servers, and hubs have identity all their own. They know their IP addresses, their routing tables, and their connections to one another. But they know nothing about their representation on a two-dimensional network diagram. To add a point to a Server object, create a new LocatedServer object, having the reference of the Server and a point.</p>
<p>The properties that an extender adds to an object are dynamic. The user can drag the server around the network diagram. But the reference that the extender has to the object it extends is definitive. If you want to add a point to another server, you have to create a new extender for it.</p>
<p><strong>Views</strong>    <br />At some point, we want to present our objects to the user. It's best to separate the user interface from the business objects that it represents. Business objects should not know how to paint themselves. This gives you some flexibility in how you present your objects. The same objects can be presented in different ways within different contexts.</p>
<p>But the user interface is itself made up of objects, too. We have forms with text boxes, radio buttons, lists, etc. These are not business objects, so it's OK that they know how to paint themselves.</p>
<p>For the user interface objects to behave correctly, they need to know about the business objects that they represent. The user interface is simply a view into the business objects. The reference that a user interface has to a business object should be definitive. A form is created to edit just one object, and cannot be switched to another.</p>
<p>Some forms have navigators. You can hit a button to advance to the next record. In this case, the form is really tied to the collection of objects, not just the one. The reference to that collection is definitive; the current position within the collection is dynamic.</p>
<p>These are just three of the most common uses for definitive behavior. Other patterns exist, but most of your definitive behavior can be categorized as one of these. Be on the look-out for ways in which these appear in your code.</p>
