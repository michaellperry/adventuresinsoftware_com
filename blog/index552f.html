		<description>Hi - I too have an online scrapbooking business.  I had been sending my emails out very plainly - so I heard about CC tonight and was so excited - ran home and started getting set up to send my first REAL OFFICIAL email tonight . . . .well, I am having the same problem you guys were having - BUT I REFUSE TO RETYPE ALL OF THOSE IN.  Because I set them up as a distribution list and not individual contacts, I can't export them?  I tried the excel thing and it didn't give me the distribution list - only the stuff I had individual contacts for.  I have emailed them and left them a message - I hope to have some sort of answer - if I do, I know it is too late now - but I will let you.</description>

		<description>Constant Contact has a tool called QuickImport that is ends up as an add on to Outlook that lets you import from Outlook automatically.  Did you download that and it not work?  It is located in the subscriber tab of the Constant Contact application.</description>
