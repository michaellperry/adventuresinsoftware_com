		<description>No, there's no technical reason. It's just so that if someone challenges "Michael", then the challenge goes to the right person. If you choose the alias "Michael" and I do too, then the system would not know which one of us your friend is challenging.</description>

		<description>Very nice, clean and straight to the point. Why does the alias need to be unique if you can always get the Live Id?  Is the alias being used as the main "login" or simply a display name?  Is this alias simply a friendly way to ensure the person receiving a challenge from a friend can distinguish between "Michael" and "Michael2".  Or is there some technical reason this is done that my puny brain is not processing?</description>
