		<description>The links all started with "http://health.thepodcastnetwork.com/wp-content/plugins/stat". It may be that the people who run the podcast have set up these link farms, or it could be that they were hacked and the link farms uploaded.</description>

		<description>Could you tell me what the link was? Winelibrary TV got attacked AGAIN last night (after I spent all day cleaning it UGGGG). I'd like to look a little more closely at my site for any of those links that were included on yours.</description>

		<description>I wrote you an email reply.
One of our blogs was compromised today at work (http://tv.winelibrary.com/). As well as a friends (http://tastyblogsnack.com). After you comment, I thought I must be affected, but my source is clean (for now).

I gave you all my contact details in the email if you'd like to try and figure this out.</description>
