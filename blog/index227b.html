		<description>I think it is remarkable that you could decide to put a great deal of effort into the design stage. And by the way, I've undergone these promotional models but one thing I want asks you, what's the difference with these promotional models to SDLC Software development Life Cycle? Can you help me, please?</description>

		<description>QA is very important, imagine, even in call centers they do have QA specialists to ensure that every agent provides the best services. This is not even about  the product released it's even monitoring and preventive measures after release.</description>

		<description>Promotional model for every production company is really the key to its success. Production consist of various pipeline where it should work in process to attain the goal the want to be. Software testing is really important in line to detect the effect of it in each pipeline.</description>

		<description>Anther problem I see is that most companies neglect their duties just right after production... Come to think of it, there should be 2 stages of QA's one on pre-production and one for post production... things may happen right after production and this is very important.</description>

		<description>The problem is, many small companies skip these stages. Many a times there is even no QA person - the developer does some unit testing, followed by some UAT and that's it!</description>

		<description>But there are some common problem occurred after the development process, like miscommunication unrealistic schedule and poor requirement. Managing all these problems is the hard part.

@valerie: Yes we also have six. After we did the QA we do the software testing.</description>

		<description>I think it is remarkable that you could decide to put a great deal of effort into the design stage. I am frequently let down in just how minimal an effort may be made by designers and experiencing your commitment to the enhancement of high quality in the software industry makes me extremely pleased. I always look for brand new ideas whenever searching for methods to motivate our designers to improve the &lt;a href="http://www.mycover.com.au" rel="nofollow"&gt; travel insurance&lt;/a&gt;  sites I am involved in taking care of, for example in &lt;a href="http://www.mycover.com.au" rel="nofollow"&gt; www.mycover.com.au &lt;/a&gt; please visit the website and provide us with your remarks. It is through this valuable interchange of information, particularly of such a specialized nature, that quality will be improved for the benefit of all. We sincerely do value your contribution and hope this is also valued by our good friends and colleagues also. Best regards, David Brown</description>

		<description>Adrian,

The promotional pipeline is just one component of the SDLC. Its only focus is on getting changes from development to production. SDLC covers the entire process, from discovery through maintenance and support. And while promotion has some very strict, nearly universal best practices, SDLC is more flexible and can be tuned to the organization.</description>
